{"songs":"Birds Trapped in the Airport by Craig Finn","lyrics":"Right now I feel a bit weightless\nA little shaky and scared\nI found a thread in the closet\nI followed it into darkness\nJames, I'm glad that you're here\nTonight I'd like you to dance with me\nJames, I'm glad that you're here\n\nI've been estranged from my family\nI fell asleep by the pool\nCigarettes with inches of ashes\nPremonitions of crashes\nWe jettisoned all the fuel\nI've been screwing computers\nJames, I'm glad you didn't die\nIt's been loveless and lonely\nIt's been faceless and easy\nIt's been weird, it's been wild\n\nTonight I'd like you to dance with me\nJames, I'm glad that you're here\nTonight I'd like you to dance with me\nWe'll be skeletons and ghosts next year\n\nWhen I went to the doctor\nI didn't feel like talking\nI just stood by the window\nActed like I was crying\nI just figured that maybe\nHe might let me skate by\nRight now I feel weightless\nJames, I'm glad you didn't die\n\nThe birds trapped in the airport\nAnd the boats in the bath\nAll the guns in the movies\nThe premonitions of crashes\nAnd the crosses and crystal\nAnd the pills in her purse\nRight now I feel a bit weightless\nLast night I felt worse\n\nTonight I'd like you to dance with me\nJames, I'm glad that you're here\nTonight I'd like you to dance with me\nWe'll be skeletons and ghosts next year\n\nTonight I'd like you to dance with me\nJames, I'm glad that you're here\nTonight I'd like you to dance with me\nWe'll be skeletons and ghosts next year\n\nTonight I'd like you to dance with me\nJames, I'm glad that you're here\nTonight I'd like you to dance with me\nWe'll be skeletons and ghosts next year\n\nTonight I'd like you to dance with me\nJames, I'm glad that you're here\nTonight I'd like you to dance with me\nWe'll be skeletons and ghosts next year","url":"https://genius.com/Craig-finn-birds-trapped-in-the-airport-lyrics"}
