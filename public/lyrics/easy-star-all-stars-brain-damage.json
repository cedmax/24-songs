{"title":"Brain Damage by Easy Star All-Stars (Ft. Dr. Israel)","lyrics":"The lunatic is on the grass\nThe lunatic is on the grass\nRemembering games and daisy chains and laughs\nGot to keep the loonies on the path\n\nThe lunatic is in the hall\nThe lunatics are in my hall\nThe paper holds their folded faces to the floor\nAnd every day the paper boy brings more\n\nAnd if the dam breaks open many years too soon\nAnd if there is no room upon the hill\nAnd if your head explodes with dark forebodings too\nI'll see you on the dark side of the moon\n\nThe lunatic is in my head\nThe lunatic is in my head\nYou raise the blade, you make the change\nYou re-arrange me 'till I'm sane\n\nYou lock the door\nAnd throw away the key\nThere's someone in my head but it's not me\nAnd if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear\nYou shout and no one seems to hear\nAnd if the band you're in starts playing different tunes\nI'll see you on the dark side of the moon\n\n\"I can't think of anything to say except...\nI think it's marvellous! HaHaHa!\"","url":"https://genius.com/Easy-star-all-stars-brain-damage-lyrics"}
