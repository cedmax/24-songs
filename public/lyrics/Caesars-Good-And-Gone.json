{"title":"Good and Gone byÂ Caesars","lyrics":"Come inside\nClose the blinds\nLet's hide away\nWe're gone\n\nLock the door\nLet them fuss about\nCould pretend\nWe're not home\n\nGood and gone\nOn our own\nAll alone\nGood and gone\nOn our own\nAll alone\n\nShut the lights\nShut the shades\nMake it all go away\nLet them scream and shout\nWe dont hear a thing\nOut of reach\nWe're gone\n\nGood and gone\nOn our own\nAll alone\nGood and gone\nOn our own\nAll alone\n\nGood and gone\nOn our own\nAll alone\nGood and gone\nOn our own\nAll alone","url":"https://genius.com/Caesars-good-and-gone-lyrics"}
