{"title":"Song for Clay (Disappear Here) by Bloc Party","lyrics":"[Intro]\nI am trying to be heroic\nIn an age of modernity\nI am trying to be heroic\nAs all around me history sinks\n\nSo I enjoy and I devour\nFlesh and wine and luxury\nBut in my heart, I am lukewarm\nNothing ever really touches me\n\n[Verse 1]\nAt the Les Trois Garçons\nWe meet at precisely 9 o'clock\nI order the foie gras\nAnd I eat it with complete disdain\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nBubbles rise in champagne flutes\nBut when we kiss, I feel nothing\nFeasting on sleeping pills\nAnd Marlboro Reds (self-pity won't save you)\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, how our, how our parents\nThey suffered for nothing\nLive the dream, live the dream, live the dream\nLike the '80s never happened\nPeople are afraid, are afraid\nTo merge on the freeway\nDisappear here\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe stroll past the queue\nInto the magazine launch party\nI'm handed a pill\nAnd I swallow it with complete disdain\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nKick drum pounds, off-beat high hats\nRemember to look bored\nWe suck each other's faces\nAnd make sure we are noticed (cocaine won't save you)\n\n[Bridge]\nBecause East London is a vampire\nIt sucks the joy right out of me\nHow we long for corruption\nIn these golden years\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, how our, how our parents\nThey suffered for nothing\nLive the dream, live the dream, live the dream\nLike the '80s never happened\nPeople are afraid, are afraid\nTo merge on the freeway\nDisappear here\n\n[Outro]\nDisappear here, disappear here\nDisappear here, disappear here","url":"https://genius.com/Bloc-party-song-for-clay-disappear-here-lyrics"}
