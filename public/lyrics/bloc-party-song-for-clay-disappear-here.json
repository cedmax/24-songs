{"title":"Song for Clay (Disappear Here) by Bloc Party","lyrics":"I am trying to be heroic\nIn an age of modernity\nI am trying to be heroic\nAs all around me history sinks\n\nSo I enjoy and I devour\nFlesh and wine and luxury\nBut in my heart, I am lukewarm\nNothing ever really touches me\n\nAt the Les Trois Garçons\nWe meet at precisely 9 o'clock\nI order the foie gras\nAnd I eat it with complete disdain\n\nBubbles rise in champagne flutes\nBut when we kiss, I feel nothing\nFeasting on sleeping pills\nAnd Marlboro Reds (self-pity won't save you)\n\nOh, how our, how our parents\nThey suffered for nothing\nLive the dream, live the dream, live the dream\nLike the '80s never happened\nPeople are afraid, are afraid\nTo merge on the freeway\nDisappear here\n\nWe stroll past the queue\nInto the magazine launch party\nI'm handed a pill\nAnd I swallow it with complete disdain\n\nKick drum pounds, off-beat high hats\nRemember to look bored\nWe suck each other's faces\nAnd make sure we are noticed (cocaine won't save you)\n\nBecause East London is a vampire\nIt sucks the joy right out of me\nHow we long for corruption\nIn these golden years\n\nOh, how our, how our parents\nThey suffered for nothing\nLive the dream, live the dream, live the dream\nLike the '80s never happened\nPeople are afraid, are afraid\nTo merge on the freeway\nDisappear here\n\nDisappear here, disappear here\nDisappear here, disappear here","url":"https://genius.com/Bloc-party-song-for-clay-disappear-here-lyrics"}
