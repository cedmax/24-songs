{"title":"Come Apart byÂ Fazerdaze","lyrics":"I saw something in your eye when you looked at me\nI get a little bit uptight what this could mean\nNow I'm trying to figure out what you were thinking\nNow I'm figuring it out, it starts to sink in\nWait a minute\nWait a minute\nWait a minute\nWait a minute\nWait a minute\nWait a minute\nWait a minute\nWait!\nWe grow apart\nWe fall apart\nWe break apart\nIt's just the start of us coming apart\n\nWhy do you, when I try to speak, yeah why do you talk over me?\nI'm fed up of skirting around the truth when you look right through me\nWait a minute\nJust admit it\nTake a minute\nTo commit to a decision\nCan we give in and\nAdmit this\nThat we've grown apart\nWe're falling apart\nDon't make this hard\nThis is just the start\nOf us coming apart\n\nApart at the seams\nPull apart at our dream\nYou were part of me\nNow we break apart\n\nI saw nothing in your eyes when you looked at me\nI've known this for a while you and me it ain't working\nSo take a minute, admit it, let's commit to it\nIt's a decision and we can get used to it\nCause we grow apart\nWe fall apart\nWe break apart\nI know it's hard\nWe're coming apart\n\nWe're coming apart","url":"https://genius.com/Fazerdaze-come-apart-lyrics"}
