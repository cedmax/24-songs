{"songs":"Wake Up Whispering by Ben Kweller","lyrics":"Wake up whispering\nBut don't wake your mom and dad\nKeep the morning quiet\nTip toe past the cat\nCan you be sweet\nAnd speak softly\nCan you keep a secret\nPromise\nHold hands whispering\nYou're such a good friend\nDo you know the mystery\nThat's going on inside our heads?\nCan you be still\nAnd hold your breath\nPut a mask on\nJust like a tall tree\nNow night time you whisper\nIt's such a good time for dreams\nThe moon and stars and everything\nAll planning there skins","url":"https://genius.com/Ben-kweller-wake-up-whispering-lyrics"}
