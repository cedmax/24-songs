{"title":"Centuries by Stars Of Track And Field","lyrics":"Fool\nCut your face\nCome down\nYou're up in space\n\nAre you here?\nOr are you there?\nJoin the cause\nOr are you scared?\n\nPut your coat on and don't ask why\nPut your coat on and don't ask why\n\nFall\nFall from bed\nCause you're alive\nYou're in my head\n\nIt's bombs for show\nUntil our fallout\n\nPut your coat on and don't ask why\nPut your coat on and don't ask why\nPut your coat on and don't ask why\nPut your coat on and don't ask\n\nShe was a kid who cried all day\nShe was a kid who cried all day\nShe was a kid who cried all day\nShe was a kid who cried all day\n\nYou're not from the cause\nShe says Mom, I am not coming home","url":"https://genius.com/Stars-of-track-and-field-centuries-lyrics"}
