{"title":"Paper Planes byÂ M.I.A.","lyrics":"I fly like paper, get high like planes\nIf you catch me at the border I got visas in my name\nIf you come around here, I make 'em all day\nI get one done in a second if you wait\nI fly like paper, get high like planes\nIf you catch me at the border I got visas in my name\nIf you come around here, I make 'em all day\nI get one done in a second if you wait\nSometimes I think sittin' on trains\nEvery stop I get to I'm clocking that game\nEveryone's a winner, we're making our fame\nBona fide hustler making my name\nSometimes I think sittin' on trains\nEvery stop I get to I'm clocking that game\nEveryone's a winner, we're making our fame\nBona fide hustler making my name\n\nAll I wanna do is\nAnd a\nAnd take your money\nAll I wanna do is\nAnd a\nAnd take your money\nAll I wanna do is\nAnd a\nAnd take your money\nAll I wanna do is\nAnd a\nAnd take your money\n\nPirate skulls and bones\nSticks and stones and weed and bongs\nRunning when we hit 'em\nLethal poison for the system\nPirate skulls and bones\nSticks and stones and weed and bongs\nRunning when we hit 'em\nLethal poison for the system\nNo one on the corner has swagger like us\nHit me on my burner prepaid wireless\nWe pack and deliver like UPS trucks\nAlready going to hell, just pumping that gas\nNo one on the corner has swagger like us\nHit me on my burner prepaid wireless\nWe pack and deliver like UPS trucks\nAlready going to hell, just pumping that gas\n\nAll I wanna do is\nAnd a\nAnd take your money\nAll I wanna do is\nAnd a\nAnd take your money\nAll I wanna do is\nAnd a\nAnd take your money\nAll I wanna do is\nAnd a\nAnd take your money\n\nM.I.A\nThird world democracy\nYeah, I've got more records than the KGB\nSo, uh, no funny business\nAre you ready all?\nSome some some I some I murder\nSome I some I let go\nSome some some I some I murder\nSome I some I let go\n\nAll I wanna do is\nAnd a\nAnd take your money\nAll I wanna do is\nAnd a\nAnd take your money\nAll I wanna do is\nAnd a\nAnd take your money\nAll I wanna do is\nAnd a\nAnd take your money","url":"https://genius.com/Mia-paper-planes-lyrics"}
