{"title":"Inside Out byÂ 999","lyrics":"Turn the wrong way your socks don't change\nYour shirt could too but the shoes are strange\nEyes are facing the other way\nIn backward talk you try to say\n\nYou're so Inside Out\nInside Out Inside Out Inside Out\nYou're so Inside Out\nInside Out Inside Out Inside Out\n\nLiving out instead of in\nDrinking tea and paraffin\nThinks aloud but don't say a word\nIt's just my visions blurred\n\nYou're so Inside Out\nInside Out Inside Out Inside Out\nYou're so Inside Out\nInside Out Inside Out Inside Out\n\nHolding head with foot in door\nCamouflage or something more\nGoes to sleep on waking up\nCoffee without a cup\n\nYou're so Inside Out\nInside Out Inside Out Inside Out\nYou're so Inside Out\nInside Out Inside Out Inside Out","url":"https://genius.com/999-inside-out-lyrics"}
