{"title":"Deceptacon by Le Tigre","lyrics":"[Intro]\nWho took the bomp?\n\n[Verse 1]\nEvery day and night, every day and night\nI can see your disco, disco dick\nIs sucking my heart out of my mind\nI'm outta time, I'm outta fucking time\nI'm a gasoline gut with a Vaseline mind, but\nWanna disco? Wanna see me disco?\nLet me hear you depoliticize my rhyme\n(One, two, three, four)\nYou got what you been asking for\nYou're so policy free and you're fantasy wheels\nAnd everything you think and everything you feel\nIs alright, alright, alright, alright, alright\n\n[Verse 2]\nI take you home, now watch me get you hot\nYou're just a parrot when you're screaming and you're shouting\n\\\"More crackers, please! More crackers, please!\\\"\nYou want what you want but you don't wanna be on your knees\nWho does your, who does your hair?\n\n[Chorus]\nWho took the bomp from the bomp-a-lomp-a-lomp?\nWho took the ram from the rama-lama-ding-dong?\nWho took the bomp from the bomp-a-lomp-a-lomp?\nWho took the ram from the rama-lama-ding-dong?\n\n[Interlude, spoken/sampled]\n\\\"How are you?\\\"\n\\\"Fine, thank you\\\"\n\\\"How are you?\\\"\n\\\"Fine, thank you\\\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou bought a new van the first year of your band\nYou're cool and I hardly wanna say \\\"not\\\"\nBecause I'm so bored\nThat I'd be entertained even by a stupid floor\nA linoleum floor, linoleum floor\nYour lyrics are dumb like a linoleum floor\nI'll walk on it, I'll walk all over you\nWalk on it, walk on it, walking one, two\n\n[Chorus]\n(Who? Who? Who? Who?)\nWho took the bomp from the bomp-a-lomp-a-lomp?\nWho took the ram from the rama-lama-ding-dong?\nWho took the bomp from the bomp-a-lomp-a-lomp?\nWho took the ram from the rama-lama-ding-dong?\n\n[Outro]\n\\\"See you later\\\"\n\\\"See you later\\\"\n\\\"See you later\\\"\n\\\"See you later\\\"","url":"https://genius.com/Le-tigre-deceptacon-lyrics"}
