(Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah)\nYou gotta want to want me (Uh-huh, yeah)\nThis is my Sex Tape! (Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah)\nYou gotta want to want me (Uh-huh, yeah)\n\nI'm at the MOMA, I'm in a painting, you pay to get in\n(Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh)\nGot my diploma in caffeinating and overdressing\n(Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh)\n\nI'm just a girl and I'll do what I want\nI'll let you hold the camera if you let me have fun\nI'm just a girl and I'll do what I want\nI'll let you hold the camera\n\nThis is my Sex Tape! (Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah)\nYou gotta want to want me (Uh-huh, yeah)\nThis is my Sex Tape! (Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah)\nYou gotta want to want me (Uh-huh, yeah)\n\n(Uh-huh, uh-huh)\nI'm Ari Aster, I cut my hair\nI am your master, I killed a bear\nI thought I knew you, I am deranged\nI'm looking through you\nI'm looking through you\nI'm Ari Aster, I cut my hair\nI am your master, I killed a bear\nI thought I knew you, I am deranged\nI'm looking through you\nI'm Doctor Strange!\n\nI'm just a girl and I'll do what I want\nI'll let you hold the camera if you let me have fun\nI'm just a girl and I'll do what I want\nI'll let you hold the camera if you let me have fun\nI'm just a girl and I'll do what I want\nI'll let you hold the camera if you let me have fun\nI'm just a girl and I'll do what I want\nI'll let you hold the camera, this is my Sex Tape!",
