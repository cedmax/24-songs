    "lyrics": "Well, you're my friend\nAnd can you see\nMany times we've been out drinking\nMany times we've shared our thoughts\nBut did you ever, ever notice\nThe kind of thoughts I got?\nWell, you know I have a love\nA love for everyone I know\nAnd you know I have a drive\nTo live, I won't let go\nBut can you see its opposition\nComes rising up sometimes?\nThat its dreadful and position\nComes blacking in my mind\n\nAnd that I see a darkness\nAnd that I see a darkness\nAnd that I see a darkness\nAnd that I see a darkness\nDid you know how much I love you?\nIs a hope that somehow you\nCan save me from this darkness\n\nWell, I hope that someday, buddy\nWe have peace in our lives\nTogether or apart\nAlone or with our wives\nAnd we can stop our whoring\nAnd pull the smiles inside\nAnd light it up forever\nAnd never go to sleep\nMy best unbeaten brother\nThis isn't all I see\n\nOh no, I see a darkness\nOh no, I see a darkness\nOh no, I see a darkness\nOh no, I see a darkness\nDid you know how much I love you?\nIs a hope that somehow you\nCan save me from this darkness",
