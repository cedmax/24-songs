    "lyrics": "You try to act surprised but it'll never work\nThe news fades over all the kids they hurt\nBut you see the real picture when America hates\nEchoing out over the flyover states\n\nSometimes silence is a loaded gun\nIn the hands of all of us\nNothing hurts like doing nothing can\nThey'll only give it up when we rip it from their cold dead hands\n\nI’ve got a problem with excuses for some\nIt’s not the worst of them it’s every last one\nDon’t expect a benefit you don’t extend to me\nYou’ve got a lot of power, you’ve got a lot of greed\n\nI just believe what I see\nComplacent ignorance and reality\nI’ve learned not to trust anyone\nLeast of all men in blue uniform",
