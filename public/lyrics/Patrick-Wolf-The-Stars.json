{"songs":"The Stars by Patrick Wolf","lyrics":"I saw I saw the stars tonight\nMama, I saw the stars tonight\n\nMama I saw the stars tonight\nOrion, the plow, the burning bright\nCannot recall where I drove\nAn empty lane, the lonely road home\n\nI saw, I saw my star tonight\nMama, the stars are burning bright\nAnd it came clear that the light years\nAre here and lost\n\nAt left, at right\nThe death, the life\nAnd all unseen came into sight\nThe pulls, the scales\nThe dark, the light\nMama, papa, voila, the night\n\nSo now to the one with the never-ending\nAnd the invisible scarves\nLook up, look up, the stars!","url":"https://genius.com/Patrick-wolf-the-stars-lyrics"}
