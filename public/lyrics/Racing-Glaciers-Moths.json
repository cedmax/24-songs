{"title":"Moths by Racing Glaciers","lyrics":"Blood all over\nBut I feel alright\nLay me down now\nIn this red stone light\n\nI knew you were danger\nI knew you were harm\nBut I kept on coming\nLike a moth to a flame\n\nBring me down when all is broken\nQuiet voice so softly spoken\n\nI'm your stranger\nOn neon roads\nSo come on over\nMy glowing rose\n\nI need your danger\nI need your harm\nTo pull me closer\n\nBring me down when all is broken\nQuiet voice so softly spoken","url":"https://genius.com/Racing-glaciers-moths-lyrics"}
