{"title":"Brown Brown Brown by Paul Baribeau","lyrics":"I saw your eyes\nThey were brown\nAnd all the stars\nWent out\nAnd the moon got lost\nAnd it fell in Lake Michigan\nAnd a tidal wave tore through this town\n\nI saw your hair, it was brown\nAnd the roof flew right off my house\nAnd then my doors broke off their hinges\nAnd all my walls came falling down\n\nYou sipped your pop, it was brown\nYou gave me a little Coca-Cola kisses\nAnd my heart broke on the night that you left\nAnd there are a few pieces that I still haven't found","url":"https://genius.com/Paul-baribeau-brown-brown-brown-lyrics"}
