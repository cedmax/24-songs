{"songs":"Her Morning Elegance by Oren Lavie - אורן לביא","lyrics":"Sun been down for days\nA pretty flower in a vase\nA slipper by the fireplace\nA cello lying in its case\n\nSoon she's down the stairs\nHer morning elegance she wears\nThe sound of water makes her dream\nAwoken by a cloud of steam\nShe pours a daydream in a cup\nA spoon of sugar sweetens up\n\nAnd she fights for her life\nAs she puts on her coat\nAnd she fights for her life on the train\nShe looks at the rain as it pours\nAnd she fights for her life\nAs she goes in a store\nWith a thought she has caught by a thread\nShe pays for the bread\nAnd she goes\n\nNobody knows\n\nSun been down for days\nA winter melody she plays\nThe thunder makes her contemplate\nShe hears a noise behind the gate\nPerhaps a letter with a dove\nPerhaps a stranger she could love\n\nAnd she fights for her life\nAs she puts on her coat\nAnd she fights for her life on the train\nShe looks at the rain as it pours\nAnd she fights for her life\nAs she goes in a store\nWith a thought she has caught by a thread\nShe pays for the bread\nAnd she goes\n\nNobody knows\nNobody knows\n\nAnd she fights for her life\nAs she puts on her coat\nAnd she fights for her life on the train\nShe looks at the rain as it pours\nAnd she fights for her life as she goes in a store\nWhere people are pleasantly strange\nAnd counting the change\nAs she goes\n\nNobody knows\nNobody knows\nNobody knows","url":"https://genius.com/Oren-lavie-her-morning-elegance-lyrics"}
