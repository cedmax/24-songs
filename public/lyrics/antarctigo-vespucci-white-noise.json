{"title":"White Noise by Antarctigo Vespucci","lyrics":"I don’t want to write it down\nI don’t want to say it out loud\n‘Cause if I do, then it’s real\nIf it’s real, then it hurts\nAnd if it hurts it could only get worse\n\nCan’t get you out of my head\nI listen to white noise instead\nCan’t get you out of my head\nIf I loved you too much, would you ever want to see me again?\n\nBlacked out on Election Day\nI’m tripping over my words on stage\nI’m a creature of fear and the fear is a curse\nAnd if I’m cursed it could only get worse\n\nCan’t get you out of my head\nI listen to white noise instead\nCan’t get you out of my head\nIf I loved you too much, would you ever want to see me again?\n\nWhen you really know me\nAnd I mean really know me\nWill you want to know me anymore?\n\nCan’t get you out of my head\nI listen to white noise instead\nCan’t get you out of my head\nIf I loved you too much, would you ever want to see me\nIf I loved you too much, would you ever want to see me\nIf I loved you too much, would you ever want to see me again?","url":"https://genius.com/Antarctigo-vespucci-white-noise-lyrics"}
