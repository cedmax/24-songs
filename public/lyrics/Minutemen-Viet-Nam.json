{"songs":"Viet Nam by Minutemen","lyrics":"Let’s say I got a number -- that number’s fifty thousand\nThat’s ten percent of five hundred thousand\nOh, here we are in French Indochina!\n\nExecutive order, congressional decision\nThe working masses are manipulated\nWas this our policy? Ten long years...\nNot one domino shall fall","url":"https://genius.com/Minutemen-viet-nam-lyrics"}
