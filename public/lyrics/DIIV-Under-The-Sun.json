{"songs":"Under the Sun by DIIV","lyrics":"Yes, I'll come back to you\nNo, I won't ask where you run\nUnder the sun\n\nYes, I'll catch up to you\nThen I'll ask, \"what have we done?\"\nUnder the sun\n\nTo be free, be awake\nBig breath that you can’t fake\nOnce you’ve begun\n\nPress my face to the back\nAll the pillars that stack\nAnd hold up the sun\n\nOn the right side coming on the right time\nOn the right time coming on the right side\n(x4)","url":"https://genius.com/Diiv-under-the-sun-lyrics"}
