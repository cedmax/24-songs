{"title":"Moving To New York by The Wombats","lyrics":"I've just had the craziest week\nLike a party bag of lies, booze, and then deceit\nAnd I don't know why I want to voice this out loud\nIt's therapeutic somehow\n\nSo I'm moving to New York, 'cause I've got problems with my sleep\nAnd we're not the same and I will wear that on my sleeve\nSo I'm moving to New York, 'cause I've got issues with my sleep\nLooks like Christmas came early, Christmas came early for me\n\nI put one foot forward and ended up thirty yards back\nAnd am I losing touch or am I just completely off the track?\nAnd I don't know why I want to voice this out loud\nIt's therapeutic somehow\n\nSo I'm moving to New York, 'cause I've got problems with my sleep\nAnd we're not the same and I will wear that on my sleeve\nSo I'm moving to New York, 'cause I've got issues with my sleep\nLooks like Christmas came early, Christmas came early for me\n\n[Instrumental]\n\nSo I'm moving to New York, 'cause I've got problems with my sleep\nAnd we're not the same and I will wear that on my sleeve\nSo I'm moving to New York, 'cause I've got issues with my sleep\nLooks like Christmas came early, Christmas came early for me","url":"https://genius.com/The-wombats-moving-to-new-york-lyrics"}
