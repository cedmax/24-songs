{"title":"Objects Of My Affection by Peter Bjorn and John","lyrics":"I remember when, when I first moved here a long time ago\n'Cause I'd heard some song I used to hear back then a long time ago\nI remember when, even further back in another town\n'Cause I saw something written I used to say back then hard to comprehend\n\nAnd the question is, was I more alive then than I am now?\nI happily have to disagree, I laugh more often now\nI cry more often now, I am more me\n\nBut of course some days I just lie around and hardly exist\nAnd can't tell apart what I'm eating from my hand or my wrist\n'Cause flesh is flesh, flesh as flesh as flesh, the difference is thin\nBut life has a certain ability of breathing new life into me, so I breathe it in\nIt tells me here we are and we all are here\nAnd it still can make sense\nIf you just show up and present an honest face\nInstead of that grin\n\nAnd the question is, was I more alive then than I am now?\nI happily have to disagree, I laugh more often now\nI cry more often now, I am more me\n\nAnd the other day, this new friend of mine said something to me\n\"Just because something starts differently doesn't mean it's worth less\"\nAnd I soaked it in, how I soaked it in, how I soaked it in\nAnd just as to prove how right he was then you came\nSo I'm gonna give, yes I'm gonna give, I'm gonna give you a try\nSo I'm gonna give, yes I'm gonna give, I'm gonna give you a try\n\nAnd the question is, was I more alive then than I am now?\nI happily have to disagree, I laugh more often now\nI cry more often now, I am more me","url":"https://genius.com/Peter-bjorn-and-john-objects-of-my-affection-lyrics"}
