    "lyrics": "It's so cold in this house\nOpen mouth swallowing us\nThe children sent home from school\nWill not stop crying\nAnd I know that you're busy, do I know that you care?\nYou got your finger on the pulse, you got your eyes everywhere\nAnd it hurts all the time when you don't return my calls\nAnd you haven't got the time to remember how it was\nIt's so cold in this house\nIt's so cold in this house\n\nI can't eat, I can't sleep\nI can't sleep, I can't dream\nAn aversion to light\nGot a fear of the ocean\n\nLike drinking poison, like eating glass\nLike drinking poison, like eating glass\nLike drinking poison, like eating glass\nLike drinking poison, like eating\n\nIt's so cold in this house\nIt's so cold in this house\nIt's so cold in this house\nIt's so cold in this bed\n\nLike drinking poison, like eating glass\nLike drinking poison, like eating glass\nLike drinking poison, like eating glass\nLike drinking poison, like eating\n\nC-c-c-come and show me\nHow, how it was\n\nWe've got crosses on our eyes\nBeen walking into the walls again\nWe've got crosses on our eyes\nBeen walking into the furniture\nWe've got crosses on our eyes\nFor richer, for poorer, for better, for worse\nWe've got crosses on our eyes\nWe've been walking into the furniture",
