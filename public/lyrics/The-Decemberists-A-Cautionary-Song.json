{"songs":"A Cautionary Song by The Decemberists","lyrics":"There's a place your mother goes\nWhen everybody else is soundly sleeping\nThrough the lights of Beacon Street\nAnd if you listen, you can hear her weeping\nShe's weeping\n\n'Cause the gentlemen are calling\nAnd the snow is softly falling on her petticoat\nAnd she's standing in the harbor\nAnd she's waiting for the sailors in the jolly boat\nSee how they approach\n\nWith dirty hands and trousers torn\nThey grapple till she's safe within their keeping\nA gag is placed between her lips\nTo keep her sorry tongue from any speaking\nOr screaming\n\nAnd they row her out to packets\nWhere the sailors' sorry racket falls for maidenhead\nAnd she's scarce above the gunwales\nWhen her clothes fall to a bundle and she's laid in bed\nOn the upper deck\n\nAnd so she goes from ship to ship\nHer ankles clasped, her arms so rudely pinioned\n'Till at last she's satisfied\nThe lot of the marina's teeming minions\nIn their opinions\n\nAnd they tell her not to say a thing\nTo cousin, kindred, kith or kin or she'll end up dead\nAnd they throw her dirty dollars\nAnd return her to the harbor where she goes to bed\nAnd this is how you're fed\n\nSo be kind to your mother\nThough she may seem an awful bother\nAnd the next time she tries to feed you collard greens\nRemember what she does when you're asleep","url":"https://genius.com/The-decemberists-a-cautionary-song-lyrics"}
