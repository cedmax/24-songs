{"title":"Six Flags in F or G by Surfer Blood","lyrics":"Caught up in a pissing contest\nGasping empty air\nI'm losing precious time\nSo don't keep me in mind\n\nNourished by my disappointment\nParasitic grief\nAnd there's no turning back\nA widow dressed in black\n\nSilence\nGolden\n\nWhere I used to look for comfort\nIs cursed hollow cold\nRight back in death's embrace\nA man without a face\n\nI became completely lucid\nSaid \"who are, who are you?\"\nI felt his icy breath\n\nWhen I turned around to face him\nI was paralyzed\nI couldn't turn around\nOr open up my eyes\n\nYou'll get over it easy, babe\nSee you're bouncing right back again\nRight now its overkill\nBut in six months it will be fine\nEven charming\nYeah\n\nIf the angels would sing today\nYou'd explain it away, I'm sure\nAnd when the nearest dream recedes\nThe dream of Reading and of Leeds\nAll going off at once in your mind\n\nOne of these days\nGonna get to the heart\nOne of these days\nWhen the bridge falls apart\nOne of these days\nRight back at the start\nOne of these days\nWe'll never be apart again\n\nBurning Six Flags in effigy\nDidn't read the report\nBut you know he's such a juggernaut\nAnd it's never not a lot\nIn the passionless void\n\nWhat a bitter macaroon\nWhat a sour eclair\nAnd this hysteria\nHas made us all aware of where\nAll the buoys are submerged\n\nOne of these days\nGonna get to the heart\nOne of these days\nWhen the bridge falls apart\nOne of these days\nRight back at the start\nOne of these days\nWe'll never ever be apart","url":"https://genius.com/Surfer-blood-six-flags-in-f-or-g-lyrics"}
