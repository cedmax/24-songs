{"songs":"Radioface by Gang of Youths","lyrics":"When I go clear, holy god\nYou and the kids are coming with\nBut in my heart, the pioneer\nWas treading on eggshells in the dark last year\nYou see those names? They'll decide\nWhat all of the cool kids so desire\nBut in my place, the borderlines\nOf calm and a coma intertwine and weave\n\nThey are infinite, more than un-infinite me\nThey are infinite, more than un-infinite me\n\nLike candles burn with shades of doubt\nIt's kinda the way we levelled out\nBut they'll see us shine on the evening news\nWhen we are the kids they write cool things about\n\nIf they are infinite, we are infinite now\nIf they are infinite, we are infinite now\n\nWhen I am old and sobered up\nAnd longing for young and violent youth\nIn my job with credit loans\nI can recall a plain and silent truth\n\nIf they are infinite, we can be infinite too\nIf they are infinite, we can be infinite too\nIf they are infinite, we are infinite too\nIf they are infinite, we are infinite too\n\nAnd my radioface is coming up live\nIf only through space and only through time\nIf what's in my hands won't keep us alive\nThen my radioface can try\nAnd my radioface is coming up live\nIf only through space and only through time\nIf what's in my hands won't keep us alive\nThen my radioface can try","url":"https://genius.com/Gang-of-youths-radioface-lyrics"}
