{"title":"Fall Back Down byÂ Rancid","lyrics":"Don't worry about me, I'm gonna make it alright\nGot my enemies cross-haired and in my sight\nI take a bad situation gonna make it right\nIn the shadows of darkness I stand in the light\nYou see it's our style to keep it true\nI had a bad year, a lot I've gone through\nI've been knocked out, beat down, black and blue\nShe's not the one coming back for you\nShe's not the one coming back for you\n\nIf I fall back down\nYou're gonna help me back up again\nIf I fall back down\nYou're gonna be my friend\nIf I fall back down\nYou're gonna help me back up again\nIf I fall back down\nYou're gonna be my friend\n\nIt takes disaster to learn a lesson\nYou're gonna make it through the darkest nights\nSome people betray one and cause treason\nWe're going to make everything alright\n\nWell, the worst of times, they don't faze me\nEven if I look and act really crazy\nOn my way down she betrayed me\nNow my vision is no longer hazy\nI'm very lucky to have my crew\nThey stood by me when she flew\nI've been knocked out, beat down, black and blue\nShe's not the one coming back for you\nShe's not the one coming back for you\n\nIf I fall back down\nYou're gonna help me back up again\nIf I fall back down\nYou're gonna be my friend\nIf I fall back down\nYou're gonna help me back up again\nIf I fall back down\nYou're gonna be my friend\n\nIf I fall back down\nYou're gonna help me back up again\nIf I fall back down\nYou're gonna be my friend\nIf I fall back down\nYou're gonna help me back up again\nIf I fall back down\nYou're gonna be my friend\n(If I fall back down)\nIf I fall back down\nYou're gonna help me back up again\n(If I fall back down)\nIf I fall back down\nYou're gonna be my friend\n(If I fall back down)\nIf I fall back down\nYou're gonna help me back up again\n(If I fall back down)\nIf I fall back down\nYou're gonna be my friend","url":"https://genius.com/Rancid-fall-back-down-lyrics"}
