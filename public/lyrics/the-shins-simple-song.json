{"title":"Simple Song by The Shins","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nWell this is just a simple song\nTo say what you done\nI told you about all those fears\nAnd away they did run\nYou sure must be strong\nAnd you feel like an ocean\nMade warm by the sun\n\nWhen I was just nine-years-old\nI swear that I dreamt\nYour face on a football field\nAnd a kiss that I kept\nUnder my vest;\nApart from everything\nBut the heart in my chest\n\n[Chorus]\nI know that things can really get rough when you go it alone\nDon't go thinking you gotta be tough, and bleed like a stone\nCould be there’s nothing else in our lives, so critical\nAs this little home\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy life in an upturned boat\nMarooned on a cliff\nYou brought me a great big flood\nAnd you gave me a lift\nGirl, what a gift!\nYou tell me with your tongue\nAnd your breath was in my lungs\nAnd we float up through the rift\n\n[Chorus]\nI know that things can really get rough when you go it alone\nDon't go thinking you gotta be tough, and bleed like a stone\nCould be there's nothing else in our lives, so critical\nAs this little home\n\n[Bridge]\nWell this would be a simple song\nTo say what you done\nI told you about all those fears\nAnd away they did run\nYou sure must be strong\nAnd you feel like an ocean\nMade warm by the sun\n\n[Chorus 2]\nRemember walking a mile to your house\nAglow in the dark\nI made a fumbling play for your heart\nAnd the act struck a spark\nYou wore a charm on the chain that I stole\nEspecial for you\nLove's such a delicate thing that we do\nWith nothing to prove\nWhich I never knew","url":"https://genius.com/The-shins-simple-song-lyrics"}
