{"title":"Simple Song by The Shins","lyrics":"Well this is just a simple song\nTo say what you done\nI told you about all those fears\nAnd away they did run\nYou sure must be strong\nAnd you feel like an ocean\nMade warm by the sun\n\nWhen I was just nine-years-old\nI swear that I dreamt\nYour face on a football field\nAnd a kiss that I kept\nUnder my vest;\nApart from everything\nBut the heart in my chest\n\nI know that things can really get rough when you go it alone\nDon't go thinking you gotta be tough, and bleed like a stone\nCould be there’s nothing else in our lives, so critical\nAs this little home\n\nMy life in an upturned boat\nMarooned on a cliff\nYou brought me a great big flood\nAnd you gave me a lift\nGirl, what a gift!\nYou tell me with your tongue\nAnd your breath was in my lungs\nAnd we float up through the rift\n\nI know that things can really get rough when you go it alone\nDon't go thinking you gotta be tough, and bleed like a stone\nCould be there's nothing else in our lives, so critical\nAs this little home\n\nWell this would be a simple song\nTo say what you done\nI told you about all those fears\nAnd away they did run\nYou sure must be strong\nAnd you feel like an ocean\nMade warm by the sun\n\nRemember walking a mile to your house\nAglow in the dark\nI made a fumbling play for your heart\nAnd the act struck a spark\nYou wore a charm on the chain that I stole\nEspecial for you\nLove's such a delicate thing that we do\nWith nothing to prove\nWhich I never knew","url":"https://genius.com/The-shins-simple-song-lyrics"}
