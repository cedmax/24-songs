{"songs":"Ugo by The Dead Pirates","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nI've been packing up my suitcase\nGot nowhere in mind\nI know I'll be missing that face\nGot nothing but time\nWill you invite me up to your place?\nI make my own wine\n\n[Refrain]\nI can hear my friends howling downstairs\nYou and me, won't get to sleep tonight\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen will we be out of this haze?\nI see you wearing out\nOh but I'll get you out of this maze\nOr push deeper inside\nIt's just a little bit of horseplay\nI've been slow cooking swine\n\n[Refrain]\nI can hear my friends howling downstairs\nYou and me, won't get to sleep tonight\n\n[Outro]\nMy girl, it's almost time\nSee when the sun goes, we will shine\nMaster, won't deny\nThat when the sun goes\nWe do shine","url":"https://genius.com/The-dead-pirates-ugo-lyrics"}
