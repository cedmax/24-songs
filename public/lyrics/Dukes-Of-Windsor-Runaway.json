{"songs":"Runaway by Dukes of Windsor","lyrics":"I'm dead scared\nTo walk away\nHow can I stop\nWhat people say\nWhen I get scared\nNever say dare\nYou can call me the runaway\nGotta keep on marching\nNever can stop me\nOut of my way\nI'm picking up speed\nA runaway\nA getaway\nRun don't stop\nDon't never stay\nThe highway\nUnder my sole\nI ran away\nTrying to find someday\nI am looking like Sunday\nI'm walking\nI found you\nAlong the way\nNow we can't stop\nWe hide away\nWhen you get scared\nNever say dare\nPeople call us the runaways\nGonna keep on marching\nNever can stop us\nOut of the way\nWe're picking up speed\nA runaway\nA getaway\nRun don't stop\nDon't never stay\nThe highway\nUnder my sole\nI left home\nTrying to find someday\nI'm walking\nFind a place where I can hide\nStep aside for a while\nI just want to disappear\nJust want to run away","url":"https://genius.com/Dukes-of-windsor-runaway-lyrics"}
