    "lyrics": "I had a corn dog\nI fell asleep\nI feel weird now\nI had a bad dream about you and me\nIt's been a few days\nI took a shower\nWatched some TV\nFed a sunflower\nI'm still learning how to be\nWhat am I supposed to do now?\nWhat am I supposed to do now?\nWhen you're still not around\nAnd you're all I think about?\n\nIt's super nice out\nAnd I'm too scared to leave my house\nSo I fall asleep on the couch\n\nWhat am I, what am I\nSupposed to do now?\nWhat am I, what am I\nSupposed to do now?\nWhat am I, what am I\nSupposed to do now?\n\nRemember last night?\nThe drunken run-in my front door had with my forehead\nThis bruise ain't so bad\nIt looks alright in kitchen lighting\nNo one will see it, cause I'm not leaving\nI'm gonna mope around instead\n\nWhat am I supposed to do now?\nWhat am I supposed to do now?\nWhen you're still not around\nAnd you're all I think about\n\nIt's super nice out\nAnd I'm too scared to leave my house\nSo I fall asleep on the couch\n\nWhat am I supposed to do now?\nWhat am I supposed to do now?\nWhen you're still not around\nAnd you're all I think about\n\nIt's super nice out\nBut I'm too scared to leave my house\nSo I listen to The Brokedowns\nThey remind me of you and I feel sorry for myself\nAnd have another corn dog and fall asleep on the couch",
