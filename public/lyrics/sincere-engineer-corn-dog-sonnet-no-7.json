{"title":"Corn Dog Sonnet No. 7 by Sincere Engineer","lyrics":"[Verse]\nI had a corn dog\nI fell asleep\nI feel weird now\nI had a bad dream about you and me\nIt's been a few days\nI took a shower\nWatched some TV\nFed a sunflower\nI'm still learning how to be\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat am I supposed to do now?\nWhat am I supposed to do now?\nWhen you're still not around\nAnd you're all I think about?\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's super nice out\nAnd I'm too scared to leave my house\nSo I fall asleep on the couch\n\nWhat am I, what am I\nSupposed to do now?\nWhat am I, what am I\nSupposed to do now?\nWhat am I, what am I\nSupposed to do now?\n\n[Bridge]\nRemember last night?\nThe drunken run-in my front door had with my forehead\nThis bruise ain't so bad\nIt looks alright in kitchen lighting\nNo one will see it, cause I'm not leaving\nI'm gonna mope around instead\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat am I supposed to do now?\nWhat am I supposed to do now?\nWhen you're still not around\nAnd you're all I think about\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's super nice out\nAnd I'm too scared to leave my house\nSo I fall asleep on the couch\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat am I supposed to do now?\nWhat am I supposed to do now?\nWhen you're still not around\nAnd you're all I think about\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's super nice out\nBut I'm too scared to leave my house\nSo I listen to The Brokedowns\nThey remind me of you and I feel sorry for myself\nAnd have another corn dog and fall asleep on the couch","url":"https://genius.com/Sincere-engineer-corn-dog-sonnet-no-7-lyrics"}
