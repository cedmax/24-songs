{"title":"Halo by Bloc Party","lyrics":"It was your hair that did it\nIt was your hair that lit the fuse\nA golden brown halo\nLike sunlight peering through trees\nI ask you for the time\nBut I am asking for so much more\nA moth to your lightbulb\nYou made my heart beat faster\n\nParalyse me with your kiss\nWipe those dirty hands on me\nMaybe we're looking for the same thing\nMaybe you're the one who will complete me\n\nOh how beauty burns\nLips and eyes and fingertips\nThe spark of desire\nOn every point our bodies meet\nBehind your eyes were stars\nInfinite and serene\nHow I could suffer for you\nYou fascinate and magnetize me\n\nParalyse me with your kiss\nWipe those dirty hands on me\nMaybe we're looking for the same thing\nMaybe you're the one who will complete me\n\nSometimes I think\nI would float away\nIf this sadness\nDidn't weigh me down\n\nParalyse me with your kiss\nWipe those dirty hands on me\nMaybe we're looking for the same thing\nMaybe you're the one who will complete me","url":"https://genius.com/Bloc-party-halo-lyrics"}
