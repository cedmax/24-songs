{"title":"A Private Understanding byÂ Protomartyr","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nNot by my own hand\nAutomatic writing by phantom limb\nNot with my own voice\nPleurisy made to stand on two legs\nThat's how I bar my door\nIn this age of blasting trumpets\nParadise for fools\nInfinite wrath\nIn the lowest deep a lower depth\nI don't want to hear those vile trumpets anymore\nConscience wakes despair\nThe night is an accumulation of dark air\nThe scholar will be forever poor\nGross gold runs headlong to boor\nI don't want to hear those vile trumpets anymore\nCall me \"Heraclitus The Obscure\"\nConstantly weeping because the river doesn't move\nIt doesn't flow\nIt's been leaded by snider men to make a profit from the poor\nI don't want to hear those vile trumpets anymore\n\n[Chorus]\nPeople live with a private understanding\nSorrow's the wind blowing through\nTruth is hiding in the wire\n\n[Verse 2]\nElvis outside of Flagstaff\nDriving a camper van\nLooking for meaning in a cloud mass\nSees the face of Joseph Stalin\nAnd is disheartened\nThen the wind changed the cloud into his smiling Lord\nAnd he was affected profoundly\nBut he could never describe the feeling\nHe passed away on the bathroom floor\n\n[Outro]\nShe's just trying to reach you\nShe's just trying to reach you\nShe's just trying to reach you\nShe's just trying to reach you\nShe's just trying to reach you\nShe's just trying to reach you\nShe's just trying to reach you\nShe's just trying to reach you\nShe's just trying to reach you\nShe's just trying to reach you\nShe's just trying to reach you\nShe's just trying to reach you\nShe's just trying to reach you\nShe's just trying to reach you\nShe's just trying to reach you\nShe's just trying to reach you\nShe's just trying to reach you\nShe's just trying to reach you\nShe's just trying to reach you","url":"https://genius.com/Protomartyr-a-private-understanding-lyrics"}
