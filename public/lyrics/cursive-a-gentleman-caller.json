{"title":"A Gentleman Caller byÂ Cursive","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nYour gentleman caller\nWell, he's been calling on another\nHe loves his forbidden fruit\nAnd as it dribbles down his chin\nHe cries: \"Baby, I've been drinking with some friends!\nNow how 'bout a little kiss...\"\nYou bad boy\nRub his nose in it\nWhat a mess\nAnd he's playing dumb\nDoo-Doo. Doo-Doo\nDoo-Doo, Doo-Doo\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm not looking for a lover\nAll those lovers are liars\nI'd never lie to you\nYou say you want to get even\nYeah, you want to get your bad man good?\nWell, are you in the mood\nYou bad girl\nDoes it feel good being bad\nAnd getting worse?\nDoo-Doo. Doo-Doo\nDoo-Doo, Doo-Doo\n\n[Bridge/Outro]\nBut in the morning\nOn the sober dawn of Sunday\nYou're not sure what you have done\nWho told you love was fleeting\nSometimes men can be so misleading\nTo take what they need from you\nWhatever you need to make you feel\nLike you've been the one behind the wheel\nThe sunrise is just over that hill\nThe worst is over\nWhatever I said to make you think\nThat love's the religion of the weak\nThis morning we love like weaklings\nThe worst is over\n\n(Doo-Doo. Doo-Doo\nDoo-Doo, Doo-Doo) x3\nThe worst is over","url":"https://genius.com/Cursive-a-gentleman-caller-lyrics"}
