{"title":"St. Justice by Albert Hammond Jr.","lyrics":"Something you said to me\nBut I can't explain it\nSomething you said to me\nI, I know you've asked it\nSomehow you found me\nThe words are in motion\nSomehow you found me\nThe words are in motion now\n\nI, I got locked in myself\nAnd I don't know what to do\nThere were dreams in my eyes\nThat now - Don't shine through\n\nSomething you said to me\nI, I can't explain it\nSomething you said to me\nI, I know you've asked it\nSomehow you found me\nThe words are in motion\nSomehow you found me\nThe words are in motion now\n\nI'm beginning to feel that\nYou don't know what you do\nIs it possibly true that motions\nGet lost on you?\nGet lost on you\n\nAnd you never grow up\nAnd you never did see\nThe world's coming down\nWas crashing right upon me\nUpon me\nAnd everyone knows\nThat you never go back\nCause you never did see\nCause we never attack\nForget me\nI'll forget you\n\nSomething you said to me\nI, I can't explain it\nSomething you said to me\nI, I know you've asked it\nSomehow you found me\nThe words are in motion\nSomehow you found me\nThe words are in motion now","url":"https://genius.com/Albert-hammond-jr-st-justice-lyrics"}
