{"title":"Sisters by Radical Face","lyrics":"I tied your shoes while you sat and watched the rain\nHands folded across your lap, and the dull look of peace across your face\nMom down the hall, Bible pressed to her chest\nShe swore the Devil hides in everything, and her room was the only safe haven left\nShe watched us grow through window panes\n\nSomething in the middle\nSomething in the middle\nSomething in the middle\nSomething's in the way\n\nYou had held my hand while the wind whistled nocturnes in the dark\n\nSomething in the middle\nSomething in the middle\nSomething in the middle\nSomething's in the way\n\nNever knew what it meant to be whole and free\n\nSomething in the middle\nSomething in the middle\nSomething in the middle\nSomething's in the way\n\nNeither one of them mocks if we steer from paths only they can see\nBut sink or swim is all they say\n\nYour hand rode the wind out the window of the train\nWe slept in our seats with our knees curled beneath our dirty chins\nDad gripped the bags like they might fly away\nAnd the scenery beyond the glass was liquid, we sat and soaked it in\nI felt your breath along the way\n\nI'd hold your hand when the sky fell apart\nAnd you'd hold my hand if you felt me slipping back into the dark\nCan't tell from the ground if the sky will fall\nCan't tell from the sky if there's anybody down there at all\nIt's empty hands and empty plates","url":"https://genius.com/Radical-face-sisters-lyrics"}
