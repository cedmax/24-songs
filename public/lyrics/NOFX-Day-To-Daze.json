{"songs":"Day To Daze byÂ NOFX","lyrics":"I trusted you at least I thought I could\nI tried to believe when you said\nI got a better job I can pay you back\nReal soon. No! I don't do those drugs no more\nI know my luck has changed my lifestyle\nHas rearranged I'm on my feet\nYou'll never change your ways\nLiving from day to daze\nWhy don't you fade away\nI've heard all this before\nWhen you we're sleeping on my floor\nYou said only for a day\nBut as those 3 weeks passed\nMy patience didn't last nor my food","url":"https://genius.com/Nofx-day-to-daze-lyrics"}
