{"songs":"Come Alive byÂ Doomriders","lyrics":"In the dead of night hear my angel call\nDarkness come alive sing to sleep my soul\nTake away my pain take away my woe\nDarkness come alive sing to sleep my soul\nDarkness come alive\nIn the dead of night see the shadows crawl\nDarkness come alive sing to sleep my soul\nIn the shadows eyes watching over me\nDarkness come alive please sing my soul to sleep\nFootsteps on the floor voices in the wall\nShapeless forms waiting in the dark\nAfraid to open eyes fear what's staring back\nDeath sits waiting for me in this endless black\nDeath's sweet lullaby\nTo the darkness pray\nMy nightmares never end\nSing to sleep my soul","url":"https://genius.com/Doomriders-come-alive-lyrics"}
