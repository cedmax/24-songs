{"songs":"To Shreds, You Say? by Iron Chic","lyrics":"It's been a long hard year\nStarted fine but it ends in tears\nOne down\nWe're that much deader\nThis one ain't shaping up much better\nIt ain't done with me\nIt ain't done with me\nSetting sail for some nasty weather\nSame old shit, just a little bit wetter\nAnd it ends right here\nBurst into flames when the sun appears\n'Cause you're done with me\nYeah, you're done with me\n\n[Chorus]\nI was wrong when I thought you might\nSomehow always be in my life\nYou'd hold on to me\nAnd never let go\nNow home feels like a prison cell\nIt's my own special kind of hell\nI've got the key\nBut nowhere to go\n\nNow one thing is clear\nI'm face to face with my greatest fear\nI'm a stone\nBaby, you're a feather\nJust leave me in the ground forever\nAnd don't mind me\nYeah, don't mind me\n\n[Chorus]\nI was wrong when I thought you might\nSomehow always be in my life\nYou'd hold on to me\nAnd never let go\nNow home feels like a prison cell\nIt's my own special kind of hell\nI've got the key\nBut nowhere to go\n\nI was wrong and you were right\nYou gave me the best years of my life\nI'll hold on to these\nHold on to these\nHold on to these\nAnd never let go\n\nI was playing with matches\nNow I sift through the ashes\nIt's cold now\nThe fire's out\nI might never be warm again\nAnd the rain comes to wash it down\nWorse to burn than it is to drown\nLet the cool water\nFill my lungs\nAnd I won't have to breathe again\nLike a ship on the ocean floor\nThat couldn't quite make the shore\nThe storm that brought me down\nStill thunders above my head\nI think back to where I was\nSafe and dry on the land above\nCould have stayed there forever\nBut all things come to an end","url":"https://genius.com/Iron-chic-to-shreds-you-say-lyrics"}
