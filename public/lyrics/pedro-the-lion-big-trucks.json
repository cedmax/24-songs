{"title":"Big Trucks by Pedro The Lion","lyrics":"Dad, Dad, why did you let that man\nPush you around like that?\nYou should have beat him down\nDown to the ground\nDown to the ground for that\n\nHe said son, you're still young\nAnd you always jump the gun\n\nThere's real people in the big, big trucks\nThat you flip off when they get in the road\nYou get so hacked that you pay no mind\nTo the great big sign that says 'oversize load'\n\nDo you really think they can go as fast\nAs you in your '87 Trans Am?\nThey know you're in such a terrible rush\nBut they're going just as fast, as fast as they can\n\nDad, Dad, I really don't understand\nWhat driving big trucks has to do with that man\nYou shoulda' taught him a lesson about being rude\nAbout talking to you with such an attitude\nHe said son, you're still young\nAnd you always jump the gun\n\nThere's real people in the big, big trucks\nThat you flip off when they get in the way\nYou get so hacked that you pay no mind\nTo the great big sign that says 'oversize load'\n\nDo you really think they can go as fast\nAs you in your '87 Trans Am?\nThey know you're in such a terrible rush\nBut they're going just as fast, as fast as they can","url":"https://genius.com/Pedro-the-lion-big-trucks-lyrics"}
