{"title":"Gemini (Birthday Song) byÂ WHY?","lyrics":"It starts with you on a mattress in your parents' old room\nClipping your toenails into the room like the room will fade\nAnd you will move onto other rooms\nAnd you will go to other places\n\nThen the wedding, then the woman passed out\nIn the driver's seat at the order board at White Castle\nWe woke her up and she went 'round to the pick-up window\nLike she knew exactly where she was\n\nThen I wept with my face in your nightshirt\nTrying hard as hell to say 'until death separates us'\nLoosening the skin on your breastbone\nI painted your nails and you sleep while I write all this down\n\nThere was a moth caught in the soapdish laminated in lye\nWill you still remember me well\nIf I don't get to 0-0-5? My dead line Gemini\n\nWhen we're on different sides of the globe\nI thought we'd keep our veins tangled like a pair of mic cables\nAnd if there ain't enough slack to reach\nThat we'd solder them together, 'cross oceans they'd stretch\n\nOur faces reflected in separate windshields\nAnd all our body hair pricked up in elephant eyelash\nShould we be tempted by thief or by saint\nIt seems I leave and you stay to crowd the cage and curse\n\nBut don't regret the done dirt\nThere is no life plan set\nYou just swallow the coal and follow your breath until death\nNow even if the will to sleep persists\nI can't cause a harsh cloth, it grazes my blisters\n\nThere was a moth cought in the soapdish laminated in lye\nWill you still remember me well\nIf I don't get to 0-0-5? Dead line Gemini\n\nToday I fell asleep in a bath of hair\nHair that once sprouted from my own white wet chalk follicles\nI swallow a coal and follow my breath\nAnd I did it with the grapefruit soap, thinking of you\nBathed, shaved, and oiled, your legs are two skinny dolphins swimming\nBetween the mattress and the layers of bedding\nTurning in your drug-dry sleep\n\nWhen I ask you to kiss my pulse\nYou offer to start the shower\nI want a verb and you give me a noun\nWhat do you dream up while I tongue you down?\n\nThere was a moth cought in the soapdish laminated in lye Will you still remember me well\nIf I don't get to 0-0-5? Dead line Gemini\n\nYou know my build\nYou know my size\nThe degree to which my eyes are astigmatic","url":"https://genius.com/Why-gemini-birthday-song-lyrics"}
