{"songs":"I Need My Girl by The National","lyrics":"[Chorus]\nI am good, I am grounded\nDavy says that I look taller\nBut I can’t get my head around it\nI keep feeling smaller and smaller\nI need my girl\nI need my girl\n\n[Verse 1]\nRemember when you lost your shit and\nDrove the car into the garden?\nYou got out and said, \"I’m sorry\"\nTo the vines and no one saw it\nI need my girl\nI need my girl\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI’m under the gun again\nI know I was a 45-percenter then\nI know I was a lot of things\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I am good, I am grounded\nDavy says that I look taller\nBut I can’t get my head around it\nI keep feeling smaller and smaller\nI need my girl\nI need my girl\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere’s some things that I should never\nLaugh about in front of family\nI tried to call you from the party\nIt’s full of punks and cannonballers\nI need my girl\nI need my girl\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI’m under the gun again\nI know I was a 45-percenter then\nI know I was a lot of things\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I am good, I am grounded\nDavy says that I look taller\nI can’t get my head around it\nI keep feeling smaller and smaller\nI keep feeling smaller and smaller\nI keep feeling smaller and smaller","url":"https://genius.com/The-national-i-need-my-girl-lyrics"}
