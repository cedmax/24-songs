{"title":"It's Catching Up byÂ Nomeansno","lyrics":"Have you heard the news?\nThe dead walk\n\nDo you hear that sound?\nDo you hear that sound?\nLike fingers scratching underground?\nDo you hear that sound?\nThat slamming door?\nI've fought it all my life\nBut I can't fight it anymore\n\nIt's catching up, I'm fucked\nA dead duck, shit outta luck\n\nHow do you hide from\nSomething you have found?\n\nDo you hear that sound?\nThat scratching sound?\nIs it better to be lost or found?\nYou can't ignore it\nYou can't talk it away\nYou can't drink it away\nYou can't fuck it away\n\nIt's catching up, I'm fucked\nA dead duck, shit outta luck\n\nGive my asylum, let me in\nI am mad, you are my only witness\n\nThere are some things that never die\nThings that never really were alive\nI've shut them out\nI've slammed the door\nBut I can't keep them back\nAnymore\n\nIt's catching up, I'm fucked\nA dead duck, shit outta luck","url":"https://genius.com/Nomeansno-its-catching-up-lyrics"}
