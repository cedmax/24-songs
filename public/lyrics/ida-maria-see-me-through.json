{"title":"See Me Through by Ida Maria","lyrics":"Oh God, now when's the time for me\nWhen will you see me through\nOh God my mind is eating my heart out\nOh God my heart is beating my mind up\nOh God, I can't believe in you\nJust because I'm afraid you're true","url":"https://genius.com/Ida-maria-see-me-through-lyrics"}
