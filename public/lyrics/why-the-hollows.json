{"title":"The Hollows by WHY? (Ft. Doseone)","lyrics":"As I lay me down to fall asleep\nWith my demons dying\nAnd my pilot light weak\nI curse the last six months\nI've been hiding behind a mustache\nYeah\nAnd to those last 10 years\nI've been howling a paper moon\nWell fuck you\n\nThis goes out to all my underdone\nOther-tongued\nLung-long frontmen\n(This is what the ghost of someone's dad says)\nAnd all us earth growths\nSome planted\nAnd some pulled\n(Shut up and put your money where your mouth is)\n\nYou shine a flashlight in\nA hat box and spin\nAn empty oyster shell\nAnd celebrate the hollows\n\nThis goes out to dirty-dancing, cursing\nBack-masking, back-slidden pastor's kids\n(From behind bars its not so hard to see he's risen)\nAnd all us earth growths\nSome planted\nAnd some pulled\n(Nobody finds god and then goes to prison)\n\nIn Berlin I saw two men fuck\nIn the dark corner of a basketball court\nJust a slight jingle\nOf pocket change pulsing\nIn the tourist park I lost 50 euros\nTo a guy with the walnut shells\nAnd the marble\nIt really pissed me off\nSo I thought I'd go back\nTo get my money\nBut all my homies warned me\n\"Oh no, those gypsies\nProlly got knives\"\n\nThis goes out to all my under-brewed\nDouble-duped, two-time truth-fools\n(Stop thinking a phone call\nOr text is too complicated)\nAnd all us earth growths\nSome planted\n(Like a married uncle at a family function)\nAnd some pulled\n\nI got them shaky gums and a couple of loose tooths\nNow tell me what should I do?\nMy God, the clock's always\nStuck tellin' 11:11, at 3:32\n\nEven just Joanna Newsom's left hand\n(I could beat the pants in bass off your best man)\n\n(This is what the ghost of someone's dad says)\nAnd all us earth growths\nDoin' the croak\nLike it ain't no joke\n\nIn a crowded room projected debonair\nAloof impermanence\nHe shrouded loosely\nIn a heavy air of indeterminance","url":"https://genius.com/Why-the-hollows-lyrics"}
