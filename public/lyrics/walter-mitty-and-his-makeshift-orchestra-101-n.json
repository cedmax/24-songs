    "lyrics": "And I drove all the way home listening to the Gaslight Anthem. And thinking how I can't stop letting people down, I'm surely not as cool as I was back in school\nI'm on the 101 falling asleep, I got the letters that you wrote for me\nNow here I am under golden arches, car in park, teary eyed, Mcgriddle in hand\n\nMy minds a slow device, I like to picture life somewhat like a Rockwell painting, but great expectations just blister the paint\nAnd I just wanna drink chocolate milk with my lovely, I just wanna burn this apartment\nAnd I just wanna float through my life merely dreaming at any given mention of the government\n\nSo i drive, heavy eyed, repeating \"tramps like us were born to run\", but I've got no one to run with\nAnd I'm cold, so I've been told that I should greet the sun and get shit done. I think I'd rather just sleep in\n\nCause we're all just twenty five words in the obituary section. And everyday is just the passing of time, I think they call this depression\nI'm not lonely, just kinda overwhelmed again. Cause I'm living proof you can still sing the blues in 2011",
