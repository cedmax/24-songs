{"title":"Muscle'n Flo byÂ Menomena","lyrics":"Oh in the morning\nI stumble, my way towards, the mirror\nAnd my makeup, it's light out, and I now\nFace just what I'm made of\n\nThere's so much more left to do\nBut I'm not young\nBut I'm not through\n\nOh in the evening\nI stumble, my way towards\nAnother daily struggle, it's dark out, it's time now\nThat I pick up my hustle\n\nMake a call, make some cash\nMake your mark, make it last\nTiny scores, tiny rooms\nLofty goals met too soon\nToo soon\n\nNow here I stand a broken man\nIf I could, I would raise my hands\nI'll come before you humbly\nIf I could I'd be on my knees\n\nCome lay down your head upon my chest\nFeel my heart beat, feel my unrest\nIf Jesus could only wash my feet\nThen I'd get up strong, and muscle on\n\nOh in the morning\nI stumble my way towards the mirror\nAnd my makeup, it's light out, and I now\nFace just what I'm made of\n\nThere's so much more left to do\nWell I'm not young, but I'm not through\nTiny scores, tiny rooms\nLofty goals met too soon\nToo soon","url":"https://genius.com/Menomena-musclen-flo-lyrics"}
