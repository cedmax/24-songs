Turn that cross upside down\nGrab a gun, baseball bat, and let's go to fuckin' town!\nLet's kill the police, I'll be saying little more\nBut when the cops come to your door\nDon't forget the choice is yours\n\nCrack rock steady\nAre you ready to stop\nThe rotten blue menace?\nLet's go kill us some cops\nCrack rock steady\nAre you ready?\nLivin' above the law\n\nPopeye!\n\nRiot sound, police come around\nWith the bass and drum, we'll knock 'em down\nChop 'em up with the riffs and in the stew\nWe'll be drinking pot liquor made of boys in blue (Pick it up!)\nSome of them livin' way up in they high-rise castles\nBe shittin' with no pork that I lick they asshole\nWith the beat, we boom down the big brass doors\nHear me now, rock steady\n\nCrack rock steady\nAre you ready to stop\nThe rotten blue menace?\nLet's go kill us a cop\nSay crack rock steady\nAre you ready?\nLivin' above the law\n\nCrack rock steady\nAre you ready to stop\nThe rotten blue menace?\nLet's go kill us some cops\nCrack rock steady\nAre you ready?\nWe said, stop!\n\nCrack rock steady\nAre you ready to stop\nThe rotten blue menace?\nLet's go kill us some cops\nThat's crack rock steady\nAre you ready?\nWe said, stop!\n\nCrack rock steady\nAre you ready to stop\nThe rotten blue menace?\nLet's go kill us some cops\nCrack rock steady\nAre you ready?\nWe said, stop!\n\nStop! One, two, three\nCrack today",
