{"title":"Shark Fin Blues by The Drones","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nStanding on the deck, I watch my shadow stretch\nThe sun pours my shadow upon the deck\nThe water's licking 'round my ankles now\nThere ain't no sunshine way, way down\nI see the sharks are in the water like slicks of ink\nHell, there's one there bigger than a submarine\nAs he circles, I look in his eye\nI see Jonah in his belly by the campfire light\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, an albatross up in the windy lofts\nYeah, he's beating his wings while he sleeps it off\nI hear the jettisoned cries from his dreams unkind\nYeah, they're whipping my ears like a riding crop\nWell, the captain once as able as a fink dandy\nHe's now laid up in the galley like a dried-out mink\nHe's laying dying of thirst and he says, or I think\n\"Well, we're gonna be alone from here on in\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nYeah, you're all my brothers and you have been kind\nBut what were you expecting to find?\nNow your eyes turn inward, countenance turn blank\nAnd I'm floating away on a barrel of pain\nIt looks like nothing but the sea and sky would remain\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Bridge]\nI say, na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na\nNa, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na\nNa, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na\nNa, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na, hey\nNa, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na\nNa, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na\nNa, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na\nNa, na-na, na-na, na-na, na, na, hey\n\n[Verse 4]\nYeah, a harpoon's shaft is short and wide\nA grappling hook's is cracked and dry\nI said, \"Why don't you get down in the sea\nOh, and turn the water red, man, like you want to be?\"\n'Cause if I cry another tear then I'll be turned to dust\nNo, the sharks won't get me but they don't feel loss\nJust keep one eye on the horizon, man, you best not blink\nThey're coming fin by fin until the whole boat sinks\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, fin by fin\nYeah, fin by fin\nYeah, fin by fin\nOh, fin by fin\nBy fin by fin\nHey, hey","url":"https://genius.com/The-drones-shark-fin-blues-lyrics"}
