{"title":"Hounds of Love by Kate Bush","lyrics":"It's in the trees\nIt's coming\n\nWhen I was a child, running in the night\nAfraid of what might be\nHiding in the dark, hiding in the street\nAnd of what was following me\nNow hounds of love are hunting\nI've always been a coward\nAnd I don't know what's good for me\n\nOh, here I go\nIt's coming for me through the trees\nOh, help me, someone, help me, please\nTake my shoes off and throw them in the lake\nAnd I'll be\nTwo steps on the water\n\nI found a fox, caught by dogs\nHe let me take him in my hands\nHis little heart, it beat so fast\nAnd I'm ashamed of running away\nFrom nothing real, I just can't deal with this\nI'm still afraid to be there\nAmong your hounds of love\nI feel your arms surrounding me\nI've always been a coward\nAnd never know what's good for me\n\nOh, here I go\nDon't let me go\nHold me down\nIt's coming for me through the trees\nOh, help me, darling, help me, please\nTake my shoes off and throw them in the lake\nAnd I'll be two steps on the water\n\nI don't know what's good for me\nI don't know what's good for me\nI need love, love, love, love, love, yeah\nYeah, yo-, yeah, yo-your love\nTake your shoes off and throw them in the lake\nDo you know what I really need?\nDo you know what I really need?\nI need love, love, love, love, love, yeah","url":"https://genius.com/Kate-bush-hounds-of-love-lyrics"}
