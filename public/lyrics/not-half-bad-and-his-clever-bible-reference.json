{"title":"And His Clever Bible Reference by Not Half Bad","lyrics":"I miss the times that I would see you doing lines inside my kitchen\nBoredom was a cheat that often times, we could defeat\nAnd wait until the sun goes down to go wreak havoc on the town\nAnd the ornaments left on their lawns, by morning time, were broke or gone\n\nAnd there's something in the air of these faded houses that we share\nTo fill with all our friends to chant and hold and sing and drink and dance\nAnd there's something in these red light rooms that once held buckets, mops and brooms\nThat now we make our slogans in and clasp them on with safety pins\n\nAnd there's something in these nights that leave us so filled up with spite\nAt knowing we will sleep again and these endeavors, soon will end\nAnd less frequently come about. Exuberance, replaced by doubt\nAnd then, at some point, will be gone, but lacking the time to ponder on","url":"https://genius.com/Not-half-bad-and-his-clever-bible-reference-lyrics"}
