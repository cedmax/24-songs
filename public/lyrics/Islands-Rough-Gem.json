{"title":"Rough Gem byÂ Islands","lyrics":"The world beat you for something nice\nYou worked hard, died poor\nYou mined what you died for\nDiamonds\n\nYou can whistle my name\nIt's the mines in Africa\nThat are to blame\nYou can scoop out my brain\nShape it into an ear and then tell me your pain\n\nHeld death at bay from the first day\nStayed awake, stayed awake\nThe rabbit was removed under the whole moon\nLong bird, short road\n\nDig deep but don't dig too deep\nWhen it's late you'll see the hole is empty\nAnd oh so deadly\nThey want me raw and smooth like glass\nThey want it fast but they don't want flaws\nI'm a girl's best friend\nCan you cut, I can cut, cause I'm a rough gem\n\nWho lives in those lights in the distance?\nWatered down, the rain will help you out\nI had a dream, it was all a dream\nBut it was ruined by the sun shining through me","url":"https://genius.com/Islands-rough-gem-lyrics"}
