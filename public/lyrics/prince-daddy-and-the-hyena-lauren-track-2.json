    "lyrics": "Lauren\nSo glad you heard me callin'\nSo glad you know my name\nAnd all my friends, well, the few left\nIt’s just me and you again\n\nStay at least 'til I'm asleep\n’Cause I'm pretty fuckin' confident\nThat I'll die the next time\nI'm alone in my bedroom\nIn my own fucking bedroom\n\nSummer\nIs right around the corner\nYou know what that means\nPeriodically your friends will all leave\nThey got their big dreams\nI get it but it fuckin' sucks\nIt's the way things go\nCome tomorrow\nA blinding afterglow\n\nStay at least 'til I’m asleep\n’Cause I'm pretty fuckin’ confident\nThat I'll die the next time\nI'm alone in my bedroom\nIn my own fucking bedroom\n\nI'm trying to move past this but no such luck\nBut you drag me the furthest from giving up\nYou asked for a smile, now there’s nothing but\nYeah, your roar's like a lion's while my mouth's taped shut\nAsk me then I'll tell you why I'm always up so late\nWhy I still call shotgun no blitz when it's just the driver and me\n\nI'm running out of friends\nWe'll sleep in different beds\n'Cause you make me wanna stay awake",
