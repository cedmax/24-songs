    "lyrics": "You'll find it hiding in shadows\nYou'll find it hiding in cupboards\nIt will walk you home safe every night\nIt will help you remember\n\nIf that's the way it is then that's the way it is\nIf that's the way it is then that's the way it is\nIf that's the way it is then that's the way it is\nIf that's the way it is then that's the way it is\n\nI still feel you in the taste of cigarettes\nWhat could I ever run to?\nJust tell me it's tearing you apart\nJust tell me you cannot sleep\n\nIf that's the way it is then that's the way it is\nIf that's the way it is then that's the way it is\n\nAnd you didn't even notice when the sky turned blue\nAnd you couldn't tell the difference between me and you\nAnd I nearly didn't notice the gentlest feeling\nThe gentlest feeling\nThe gentlest feeling\nThe gentlest feeling\n\nYou are the bluest light (You are the bluest light)\nYou are the bluest light (You are the bluest light)\nYou are the bluest light (You are the bluest light)\nYou are the bluest light (You are the bluest light)\nYou are the bluest light (You are the bluest light)\nYou are the bluest light (You are the bluest light)\nYou are the bluest light (You are the bluest light)\nYou are the bluest light (You are the bluest light)",
