{"title":"Garbage Universe by Cold Wrecks","lyrics":"You only show up in my head when I can’t sleep\nAnd I used to think I could see you\nIn different cities\n\nAnd I’m letting go, but I’d like to know\n\nAbout a handful of nights\nWhen a couple things felt right\nAbout a handful of days\nWhen all we could say was goodbye\nAnd I’m letting go, but I’d like to know\n\nI know this is growing up I’m starting to see\nBut now when I see you my throat closes up\nI can’t breathe\n\nIt’s only getting worse in this garbage universe\n\nBut there was a handful of nights\nWhen a couple things felt right\nThere was a handful of days\nWhen all we could say was goodbye\n\nThere’s nothing to let go\nThere’s nothing left to know\n\nAbout a handful of nights\nWhen a couple things felt right\nAbout a handful of days\nWhen all we could say was goodbye","url":"https://genius.com/Cold-wrecks-garbage-universe-lyrics"}
