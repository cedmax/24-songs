{"title":"C'est La Vie Way by Wolf Parade","lyrics":"Why In your c'est la vie way\nDid you cry, cry, cry\nWhen you were listening to a mixtape from your friends?\n\nDo you miss them\nIn your c'est la vie way\nMore than you'd missed me if you'd stayed\nIn the hemisphere I asked you to return from?\n\nOr maybe you can pull apart your mind\nLike if there's a Russian doll\nInside another Russian doll\nYou see it all in your c'est la vie way\n\nSo I, I'll try and be a decent partner\nTry to keep the teardrops off your face\nBe kind enough to regard\n\nIn your c'est la vie way\nIn your c'est la vie way\nIn your c'est la vie way\nIn your c'est la vie way\n\nThe ceremony was alright\nBut like most ceremonies it\nLacked a gravity that I\nWould have liked\n\nThere were too many cameras out\nAnd the microphone gave out as she adjusted her gown\nSo the crowd couldn't make out the first half of his busted vows\n\nYou said if you ever leave me I will die\nI could have died it was so cheap\nOh come on father set us free\nBut our hearts fell apart anyway\nWhen we heard her say c'est la vie\n\nOh yes our hearts fall apart anyway\nWhen we heard her say c'est la vie","url":"https://genius.com/Wolf-parade-cest-la-vie-way-lyrics"}
