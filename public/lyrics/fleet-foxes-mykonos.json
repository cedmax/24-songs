    "lyrics": "The door slammed loud and rose up a cloud of dust on us\nFootsteps follow down through the hollow sound, torn up\n\nAnd you will go to Mykonos\nWith a vision of a gentle coast\nAnd a sun to maybe dissipate\nShadows of the mess you made\n\nPallid animals in the snow-tipped pines I find\nHatching from the seed of your thin mind all night\n\nAnd you will go to Mykonos\nWith a vision of a gentle coast\nAnd a sun to maybe dissipate\nShadows of the mess you made\n\nBrother, you don't need to turn me away\nI was waiting down at the ancient gate\n\nYou go\nWherever you go today\nYou go today\n\nI remember how they took you down\nAs the winter turned the meadow brown\n\nYou go\nWherever you go today\nYou go today\n\nWhen out walking, brother, don't you forget\nIt ain't often that you'll ever find a friend\n\nYou go\nWherever you go today\nYou go today\n\nYou go\nWherever you go today\nYou go today\nYou go\nWherever you go today\nYou go today\nYou go\nWherever you go today\nYou go today\nYou go\nWherever you go today\nYou go today\nYou go\nWherever you go today\nYou go today\nYou go\nWherever you go today\nYou go today",
