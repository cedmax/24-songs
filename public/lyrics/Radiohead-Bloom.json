{"songs":"Bloom byÂ Radiohead","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nOpen your mouth wide\nA universal sigh\nAnd while the ocean blooms\nIt's what keeps me alive\nSo why does this still hurt?\nDon't blow your mind with whys\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm moving out of orbit\n(Turning in somersaults)\nTurning in somersaults\n(A giant turtle's eyes)\nA giant turtle's eyes\n(As jellyfish float by)\nAs jellyfish float by\n\n[Outro]\nIt's what keeps me alive","url":"https://genius.com/Radiohead-bloom-lyrics"}
