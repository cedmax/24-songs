{"songs":"Ghouls by We Are Scientists","lyrics":"We all recognise that I'm the problem here\nWe all recognise that I'm the problem here\n\nIt's impossible to know or so it seems\nWhat I'm supposed to do with you on anything\nI know that playing this time is going to fall on me\nCause we all recognise that I'm the problem here\n\nCan't help but feel attacked, what's that supposed to mean\nI know I won't relax or act like it's no big deal\nThis happens all the time; it's kind of our routine\nBut we all recognise that I'm the problem here\n\nWe all recognise that I'm the problem here\nWe all recognise that I'm the problem here\nWe all recognise that I'm the problem here\nWe all recognise that I'm the problem","url":"https://genius.com/We-are-scientists-ghouls-lyrics"}
