{"songs":"Ghosting by Mother Mother","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nI've been ghosting, I've been ghosting along\nGhost in your house, ghost in your arms\nWhen you're tossing, when you turn in your sleep\nIt's because I'm ghosting your dreams\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd this is why I have decided\nTo pull these old white sheets from my head\nI'll leave them folded neat and tidy\nSo that you'll know I'm out of hiding\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've been ghosting, I've been ghosting alone\nGhost in the world, ghost with no home\nI remember, I remember the days\nWhen I'd make you oh so afraid\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd this is why I have decided\nTo leave your house and home unhaunted\nYou don't need poltergeists for sidekicks\nYou don't need treats and you don't need tricks\n\n[Bridge]\nYou don't need treats, you don't need tricks\nYou don't need no Halloween\nYou don't need treats, you don't need tricks\nAnd you don't need me\n\nMe...\n\nHey, would it be so bad if I stayed\nI'm just a ghost out of his grave\nAnd I can't make love in my grave\nI won't put white into your hair\nI won't make noises in your stairs\nI will be kind and I'll be sweet\nIf you stop staring straight through me\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd this is why I have decided\nTo pull these old white sheets from my head\nI'll leave them folded neat and tidy\nSo that you'll know I'm out of hiding\n\nAnd this is why I have decided\nTo leave your house and home unhaunted\nYou don't need poltergeist for sidekicks\nYou don't need treats and you don't need tricks\n\n[Outro]\nYou don't need treats, you don't need tricks\nYou don't need no Halloween\nYou don't need treats, you don't need tricks\nYou don't need treats, you don't need no Hallows Eve\nYou don't need treats, you don't need tricks\nAnd you don't need me...","url":"https://genius.com/Mother-mother-ghosting-lyrics"}
