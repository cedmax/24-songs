{"songs":"Life byÂ Awakebutstillinbed","lyrics":"I couldn't get my life back\nI couldn't get my life back, I couldn't save myself\n\nAll the words of my mother hang heavy over me\nIt's summer in Texas, 2003\nI dissociate, the world around me fades\nThere is no self if there is no one else\n\nSo I isolate and suppress discomfort\nAnd I sacrifice any shred of my own self-worth\nWhile I put so much faith in my open eyes\nI have never felt so lonely and desperate\n\nI couldn't get my life back\nI couldn't get my life back, I didn't stand a chance\n\nAll the pain within my past weighs heavy on my heart\nThe euphoria won't last, it'll tear your life apart\nI feel the same; the world around me changed\nIt is a mess, and I could not make sense\n\nOf this brave new world I navigate alone\nOr my hyper-vulnerability I now call home\n'Cause I put so much trust in their shifting words\nAnd I have never felt so stupid and useless before\n\nBut it is all my fault\nI never should have trusted them\nIt's easy to smile and wave, to tell them one thing to their face\nIt's hard to tell the truth\nYeah, it is all my fault\nBut how could I have known that\nWhat people call low self-esteem is really just seeing yourself\nThe way other people see you?\n\nI couldn't get my life back\nI couldn't get my life back\nI couldn't get my life back\nI couldn't get my life back","url":"https://genius.com/Awakebutstillinbed-life-lyrics"}
