    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHow I wish you could see the potential\nThe potential of you and me\nIt's like a book elegantly bound, but\nIn a language that you can't read just yet\n\n[Chorus]\nYou gotta spend some time, love\nYou gotta spend some time with me\nAnd I know that you'll find, love\nI will possess your heart\nYou gotta spend some time, love\nYou gotta spend some time with me\nAnd I know that you'll find, love\nI will possess your heart\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere are days when, outside your window\nI see my reflection as I slowly pass\nAnd I long for this mirrored perspective\nWhen we'll be lovers, lovers at last\n\n[Chorus]\nYou gotta spend some time, love\nYou gotta spend some time with me\nAnd I know that you'll find, love\nI will possess your heart\nYou gotta spend some time, love\nYou gotta spend some time with me\nAnd I know that you'll find, love\nI will possess your heart\n[Post-Chorus]\nI will possess your heart\nI will possess your heart\n\n[Bridge]\nYou reject my advances\nAnd desperate pleas\nI won't let you let me down\nSo easily\nSo easily\n\n[Chorus]\nYou gotta spend some time, love\nYou gotta spend some time with me\nAnd I know that you'll find, love\nI will possess your heart\nYou gotta spend some time, love\nYou gotta spend some time with me\nAnd I know that you'll find, love\nI will possess your heart\nYou gotta spend some time, love\nYou gotta spend some time with me\nAnd I know that you'll find, love\nI will possess your heart\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nI will possess your heart\nI will possess your heart",
