{"title":"Kids byÂ MGMT","lyrics":"You were a child crawling on your knees toward it\nMaking mama so proud but your voice is too loud\nWe like to watch you laughing\nYou pick the insects off plants, no time to think of consequences\n\nControl yourself, take only what you need from it\nA family of trees wanted to be haunted\nControl yourself, take only what you need from it\nA family of trees wanted to be haunted\n\nThe water is warm but it's sending me shivers\nA baby is born crying out for attention\nThe memories fade like looking through a fogged mirror\nDecision to decisions are made and not bought\nBut I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not\n\nControl yourself, take only what you need from it\nA family of trees wanted to be haunted\nControl yourself, take only what you need from it\nA family of trees wanted to be haunted\n\n[Instrumental]\n\nControl yourself, take only what you need from it\nA family of trees wanted to be haunted\nControl yourself, take only what you need from it\nA family of trees wanted to be haunted\nControl yourself, take only what you need from it\nA family of trees wanted to be haunted\nControl yourself, take only what you need from it\nA family of trees","url":"https://genius.com/Mgmt-kids-lyrics"}
