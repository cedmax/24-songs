{"title":"Be free by King Dude","lyrics":"Last night I was free\nOutside in the field\nWhere we both fell in love\nAnd I knew it was real\nYou put me outside\nI was singing a song\nYou looked to the window\nBut I was already gone\n\nThe wind was whipping, licking like tongues\nAnd our skin like the heavens\nClouds in our lungs\nI saw my reflection\nAnd I talked to the glass\nI think about you and I think of the past\n\nIf you wanna be free, don't think about me\nDon't you look in my eyes\nDon't you hang around me\nNo more, oh\n\nThe thing that you want is what's killing me\nDon't you dare take my hand\nIf you won't be free, oh no\n\nYour face like a painting in your historic mind\nBut you barely survived\nAnd you're barely alive\nThose rules of lost days that we buried in time\nI carried the baby it felt dead inside\n\nWell you carried my child\nI planted my seed\nI know it was wrong, but you know what I need\nYou saw it in my eyes when you were looking at me\nYou keep darkening my doorway\nYour love sets me free, oh\n\nIf you wanna be free, don't think about me\nDon't you look in my eyes\nDon't you hang around me\nNo more, oh\nAnd the thing that you want is the thing that's killing me\nDon't you dare take my hand\nIf you won't be free, oh no no","url":"https://genius.com/King-dude-be-free-lyrics"}
