{"title":"Anti-Anti by Snowden","lyrics":"I huff gasoline from your shirt\nAnd blur the questions that no one could ever answer\nI empty my head of all that I know\nSeems like the best view is the one from below\n\nWe are anti-movements, we are anti-anti\nOne time we believed but now we don't even try\nAnd I can't cut a rug, without my fashion drugs\nInebriation leads revelation\n\nGettin' down in the town that makes no sound\nGettin' down in the town that makes no sound\n\nYou say there's nothing wrong but I don't hear it\nYou say there's nothing wrong but I don't hear it\n\nGettin' down in the town that makes no sound\nGettin' down in the town that makes no sound\n\nI will burn your love letters in a parking deck\nWhere I have harbored great things that I will never confess\nWe keep fresh paint on the countenance\nNow we keep it simple but make it more complex\n\nWe are anti-movements, we are anti-anti\nOne time we believed but now it's passé and cliché\nAnd she'll say anything to make you move again\nBut is it the truth? I don't care if it is\nGettin' down in the town that makes no sound\nGettin' down in the town that makes no sound\n\nYou say there's nothing wrong but I don't hear it\nYou say there's nothing wrong but I don't hear it\n\nGettin' down in the town that makes no sound\nGettin' down in the town that makes no sound","url":"https://genius.com/Snowden-anti-anti-lyrics"}
