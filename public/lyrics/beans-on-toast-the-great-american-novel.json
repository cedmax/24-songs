    "lyrics": "As the Sunday sun sets down on Reno, Nevada\nI'm not really a gambling man, but I'm quite partial to a flutter\nAnd if you're playing Black Jack, they'll let you drink for free\nAnd that sounds like a pretty good deal to me\n\nSo I pull up to a table, and I sink my first Coors Light\nI get chatting to an old man, sat by my side\nHe can't quite place my accent and he asks me where I'm from\nLike many before he thinks that I'm Australian\n\nI tell him I'm from England, from Essex to be precise\nWe both lose a couple of hands and sink some more Coors Light\nHe asks me what I'm doing, so far away from home\nI tell him I've been singing on the road\n\nHe asks me where I've been\nWhat I've seen\nAnd what I might have learnt\nTravelling on this giant piece of dirt\n\nI've seen the rivers and the mountains, the forests through the trees\nI've seen the deserts and canyons, I've seen the tumbleweed\nI watched the sunset of the west coast, with sand between my toes\nI've been East freezing my bollocks off, in six inches of snow\nI've seen the interstates and freeways, from my rental car\nMostly though, I've seen a lot of bars\nI've seen a few music venues and a, shit-tonne of bars\n\nLondon, Gatwick, JFK, Boston, Baltimore\nTo the American Visionary Art Museum down the Appalachian Trail\nTo the suburbs of Atlanta and the Gainesville BBQ\nWhere I ended in a karaoke bar doing Jimmy Buffet tunes\nLeft onto the I10, the \"Big Easy\", New Orleans\nI played a bit of washboard with my main I felt like Chris Christopherson, flat out in Baton Rouge\nWhen they let me sing some songs in the Red Dragon listening room\nIn fact I've been singing songs every time I stop\nSomehow I'm calling this my job\n\nI've heard the banjos and the trumpets, been to where the blues was born\nDanced to dubstep and to punk rock, and I shopped in record stores\nI read the Great American Novel, by the Great American Novelist\nAnd give me half a chance, I'll build myself a white picket fence\nCause I love the American culture, its music, books and poetry\nAnd the wonderful Americans that I've met on my journey\n\nFlashback to the casino and the old man he said \"Son\nSounds like you've seen more of this country than I have ever done\nI come from Salt Lake City, that's where I was born and raised\nI still live in Utah and I barely left the state\nBut you still haven't told me what you've learnt\nSounds like you're just driving round and getting drunk\nAnd it's not like you're any good at Blackjack either\nYou haven't won a dollar since you've been here\n\nI've seen casinos and the churches, the prisons and the shopping malls\nThe ballparks and the stadiums, the junk-food drive-throughs\nThe fast cars and the titty bars, the broken traffic lights\nThe homeless and forgotten folk, downtown late at night\nAnd I've seen the foreign policy, the oily, bloody hands\nI've seen the police brutality sweep across the land\nAnd if there's one thing that I've learned\nIt's that a dollar costs more than it's worth\nI didn't come in here to win\nI just came in for a drink",
