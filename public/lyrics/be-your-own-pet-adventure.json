{"title":"Adventure by Be Your Own Pet","lyrics":"We are adventuring, we are adventurers\nIn the heart of Nepal we ran into trouble\nWhen thieves caught sight of our elegant rubble\nThey ransacked our camp without saying goodnight\n\nOkay, so yeah, but it was cool\n'Cause we're, like, adventurers\n\nWe are adventuring, we are adventurers\nWe've been to every place, everywhere in the world\nWe are adventuring, we are adventurers\n\nWe are adventuring we are adventurers\nDeep in the fall, it was blazing hot\nBelow the equators the sunlight would start\nWe've travelled through jungles and tigers we've fought\n\nIt's all cool, you know\n'Cause we're, like, adventurers\n\nWe are adventuring, we are adventurers\nWe've been to every place, everywhere in the world\nWe are adventuring, we are adventurers\n\nIn castles and causeways and monasteries and hideaways\nIn castles and causeways and monasteries and hideaways\nCastles and causeways and monasteries and hideaways\nIn castles and causeways and monasteries and hideaways\n\nWe are adventuring, we are adventurers\nWe've been to every place, everywhere in the world\nWe are adventuring, we are adventurers\nWe've been to every place, everywhere in the world\n\nOh and it's such fun with all these sights we've seen\nOh and it's such fun with all these sights we've seen\nOh and it's such fun with all these sights we've seen\nOh and it's such fun with all these sights we have seen","url":"https://genius.com/Be-your-own-pet-adventure-lyrics"}
