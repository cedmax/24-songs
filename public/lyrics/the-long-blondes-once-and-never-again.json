{"title":"Once and Never Again by The Long Blondes","lyrics":"19. You're only 19 for God's sake\nOh, you don't need a boyfriend\n19. You're only 19 for God's sake\nOh, you don't need a boyfriend\n\nLook what he's made you do to your arm again\nHe said he'd come round but he's gone out with his friends\nAnd I know how it feels to be your age\nAnd feel the world is caving in\n\nAnother drama by the kitchen sink tonight\nYou said you'd cut yourself whilst washing up the knives\nAnother week off school won't do you any good\nAnd I know how it feels to be your age\n\n19. You're only 19 for God's sake\nOh, you don't need a boyfriend\n19. You're only 19 for God's sake\nOh, you don't need a boyfriend\n\nCome back with me, and find out what you really want\nCome home with me you'll only have to do it once\n'Cause I know what it feels like to be your age\nYou only have to do it once\nAnd never again\n\nAnother drama by the kitchen sink tonight\nYou said you'd cut yourself whilst washing up the knives\nAnother week off school won't do you any good\nAnd I know how it feels to be your age\n\nYou know I'm not so young\nI spend an hour getting ready every day\nAnd still I end up looking more or less the same\nBut I could show you\nA thing or two\n\nOh, I could show you the ropes\nYes I could show you the ropes\nAnd I would cut my hair for you\n'Cause I know how it feels\n\nI know how it feels to be your age\nI know how it feels to be your age\nOh, how I'd love to feel a girl your age\nYour age\nOnce and never again","url":"https://genius.com/The-long-blondes-once-and-never-again-lyrics"}
