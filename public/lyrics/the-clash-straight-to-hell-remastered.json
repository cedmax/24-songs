    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nIf you can play on fiddle\nHow's about a British jig and reel?\nSpeaking King's English in quotation\nAs railhead towns feel the steel mills rust\nWater froze in the generation\nClear as winter ice\nThis is your paradise\n\nThere ain't no need for ya\nThere ain't no need for ya\nGo straight to hell boys\nGo straight to hell boys\n\n[Verse 2]\nWanna join in a chorus\nOf the Amerasian blues?\nWhen it's Christmas out in Ho Chi Minh City\nKiddie say papa papa papa papa papa-san take me home\nSee me got photo photo\nPhotograph of you\nAnd Mamma Mamma Mamma-san\nOf you and Mamma Mamma Mamma-san\nLet me tell you 'bout your blood bamboo kid\nIt ain't Coca-Cola, it's rice\nStraight to hell, boy\nGo straight to hell boy\nGo straight to hell boys\nGo straight to hell boys\n\nOh Papa-san\nPlease take me home\nOh Papa-san\nEverybody they wanna go home\nSo Mamma-san says\n\nYou wanna play mind-crazed banjo\nOn the druggy-drag ragtime U.S.A.?\nIn Parkland International\nHa, Junkiedom U.S.A\nWhere procaine proves the purest rock man groove\nAnd rat poison\nThe volatile Molotov says\n\nHah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah\nStraight to hell\n\n[Verse 3]\nCan you cough it up loud and strong\nThe immigrants\nThey wanna sing all night long\nIt could be anywhere\nMost likely could be any frontier\nAny hemisphere\nNo man's land\nThere ain't no asylum here\nKing Solomon he never lived 'round here\nStraight to hell boy\nGo straight to hell boy\nGo straight to hell boys\nGo straight to hell boys\nOh Pappa-san, please take me home\nEverybody they wanna go home now",
