{"title":"Twilight Omens by Franz Ferdinand","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nI wrote your name upon the back of my hands\nSlept upon it and I woke up with it\nBackwards on my face\nReading forwards from my mirror\nTo my heart\n\n[Chorus]\nTwilight omens in my life\nThen I hear your name\nHear the radio sing your name\nShould I give you a call\nWhat can I say\nMaybe you still feel the same\n\n[Verse 2]\nI typed your number into my calculator\nWhere it's spelled a dirty word\nWhen you turn it upside down\nYou can turn my dirty world\nThe right way round\n\n[Chorus]\nTwilight omens in my life\nThen I hear your name\nHear the radio sing your name\nShould I give you a call\nWhat can I say\nMaybe I still feel the same\n\n[Outro]\nTwilight omens in my life\nKeep hearing your name [x3]\nKeep hearing you sing your name","url":"https://genius.com/Franz-ferdinand-twilight-omens-lyrics"}
