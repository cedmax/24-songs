{"songs":"Mascara Lies by Tim Fite","lyrics":"If I could take the tears from your eyes\nIf I could take the dye from your hair\nIf I could take the mascara lies\nI'd leave 'em here\n\nIf I could take you to the summer dance\nIf I could take you out with all my friends\nIf I could take you home to meet my parents\nI wouldn't still, your sittin' still\n\nIf I could take the spite from your arms\nIf I could take the bite from your kiss\nIf I could take you mad scary charm\nAnd put it to rest...\n\nYou could fall asleep on my chest\nYou could fall asleep on my chest\nAnd wake up feeling like you never left","url":"https://genius.com/Tim-fite-mascara-lies-lyrics"}
