    "lyrics": "You stop stopping by to say hello\nYou started starting up each time I phone\nI only call when I get the blues\nYou think at least I could turn to you\nBut I'm sure your heart is breaking too\n\nIt's getting better every day\nI still reserve the right to complain to you\nThat being said I rarely do\nYou left me with nothing left to lose\nBut I'm sure your heart is breaking too\n\nI see you find the way to pass the time\n\"You'd like him, he's a lot like you\"\nI didn't see you getting saddled up so soon\n\"Babe, I know you'll find somebody too\"\nMaybe another week to recoup\n\"It's never easy but we'll make it through\"\nYeah, I'm sure your heart is breaking too\n\nI can't imagine how hard it's been\nOn second thought you don't seem to give a shit\nYou claim you're in pain but where's the bruise?\nYeah, I'm sure your heart is breaking too",
