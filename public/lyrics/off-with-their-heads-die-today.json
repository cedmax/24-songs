{"title":"Die Today by Off With Their Heads","lyrics":"I'm not gonna go to work today\nI want to feel the sun shine on my face\nAnd pretend like everything's okay\nWon't let anything get to me\nMy morning coffee and cigarettes to blaze\nOut on the porch with my insanity\n\nYeah, I'm gonna be a bum and sit out here all day long\nDo it all my own way\nYeah, I'm gonna be a bum and sit out here all day long\nI'm not gonna go to work today\n\nI'm not gonna go to work today\nI want to feel the sun shine on my face\nAnd pretend like everything's okay\nWon't let anything get to me\nI'm not gonna go to work today\nI want to feel the sun shine on my face\n\nYeah, I'm gonna be a bum and sit out here all day long\nI'm not gonna go away\nI'm gonna be a bum, sit out here all day long\nI don't want to go\n\nI just want to fucking cry today\n'Cause nothing ever goes my way\nI've spent all my money on cocaine\nAnd I still got rent and bills to pay\nEveryone's so fucking pissed at me\nThe reasons why are so obvious to see\n\nI don't care about anyone\nWhen the dealer's paid and gone and the pain is relieved\nI'll tie it tight around my neck, kick the chair out with my legs\n'Cause I want to fucking die today\n\nYeah, die today","url":"https://genius.com/Off-with-their-heads-die-today-lyrics"}
