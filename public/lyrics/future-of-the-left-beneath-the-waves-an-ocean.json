{"title":"Beneath the Waves an Ocean by Future of the Left","lyrics":"Three men walk into a café\nTake a corner booth - and wait for context\nExcuse me madam, this service is a joke\nI came in here for anecdotes and left with\nFriends I'll never sing for\n\nYou're not just a punchline now\nYou're more than the end of something\nDon't get found out\n\nNo fish - mother can't do seafood\nDrop omega three - in her brandy\nWaiter waiter, there's movement in my soup\nI swear I saw the chicken making eyes across\nThe table at me\n\nYou're not just a punchline now\nYou're more than the end of something\nDon't get found out\n\nNo way, you'll never find peace\nYou'll never find peace with the name they gave you\nNo way, you'll never find peace\nYou'll never find peace with the name you've got\nNo way, you'll never find peace\nYou'll never find peace with the name they gave you\nNo way, you'll never find peace\nYou'll never find peace with the name you've got","url":"https://genius.com/Future-of-the-left-beneath-the-waves-an-ocean-lyrics"}
