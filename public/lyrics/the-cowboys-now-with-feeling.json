{"title":"Now With Feeling by The Cowboys","lyrics":"And if you got a cork up in your ears\nI got something that you need to hear\nAnd it's to make myself clear\nYou'd be something up a gun\n\nYou want a girl\nBut the girl don't want you\nBecause you send her away to the jail\n\nYou need to look real dig besides yourself\nBut I'm not sure you will\n\nYou got one more chance to make this right\nA dance all through the gentle night\nNow with feeling\nNobody move, nobody can't touch, is nobody really away?\n\n(?)","url":"https://genius.com/The-cowboys-now-with-feeling-lyrics"}
