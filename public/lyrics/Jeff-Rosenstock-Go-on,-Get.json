{"songs":"Go on Get by Jeff Rosenstock","lyrics":"When waking up is\nSuch a headache you don’t\nWanna wake up\nDon’t have a nervous breakdown\n\nQuit your job and go outside\nQuit your job and get outside\nOr at least call in sick and go out tonight\nOr at least call in sick and get drunk tonight\n\nThey embed it:\nYou’re expendable so\nBe expendable\nBurn the building down and\n\nQuit your job and go outside\nQuit your job and get outside\nBlow it off and get stoned and pass out tonight\nTear the clouds down and fuck in the sky tonight\n\nQuit your job and go outside\nQuit your job and get outside\nBurn the building down, get stoned and fuck tonight\nBlow it off, go out and get drunk tonight","url":"https://genius.com/Jeff-rosenstock-go-on-get-lyrics"}
