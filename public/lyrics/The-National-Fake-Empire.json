{"songs":"Fake Empire by The National","lyrics":"Stay out super late tonight\nPicking apples, making pies\nPut a little something in our lemonade and take it with us\nWe're half awake in a fake empire\nWe're half awake in a fake empire\n\nTiptoe through our shiny city\nWith our diamond slippers on\nDo our gay ballet on ice, bluebirds on our shoulders\nWe're half awake in a fake empire\nWe're half awake in a fake empire\n\nTurn the light out, say goodnight\nNo thinking for a little while\nLet's not try to figure out everything at once\nIt's hard to keep track of you falling through the sky\nWe're half awake in a fake empire\nWe're half awake in a fake empire","url":"https://genius.com/The-national-fake-empire-lyrics"}
