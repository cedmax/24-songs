    "lyrics": "I been trying to do it right\nI been living a lonely life\nI been sleepin' here instead\nI been sleepin' in my bed\nI been sleepin' in my bed\n\nSo show me family\nAll the blood that I will bleed\nI don't know where I belong\nI don't know where I went wrong\nBut I can write a song\n\nI belong with you, you belong with me\nYou're my sweetheart\nI belong with you, you belong with me\nYou're my sweetheart\n\nI don't think you're right for him\nThink of what it might have been if we\nTook a bus to Chinatown\nI'd be standin' on Canal, and Bowery\nAnd she'd be standin' next to me\n\nI belong with you, you belong with me\nYou're my sweetheart\nI belong with you, you belong with me\nYou're my sweetheart\n\nLove we need it now\nLet's hope for some\nCause oh, we're bleedin' out\n\nI belong with you, you belong with me\nYou're my sweetheart\nI belong with you, you belong with me\nYou're my sweetheart",
