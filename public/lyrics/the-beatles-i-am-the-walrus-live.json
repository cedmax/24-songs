{"title":"I am the walrus - live by The Beatles Revival Band","lyrics":"I am he as you are he as you are me\nAnd we are all together\nSee how they run like pigs from a gun see how they fly\nI'm crying\nSitting on a cornflake waiting for the van to come\nCorporation teeshirt, stupid bloody Tuesday\nMan you've been a naughty boy. You let your face go long\nI am the eggman, they are the eggmen\nI am the walrus, goo goo goo joob\nMister City Policeman sitting, pretty little policemen in a row\nSee how they fly like lucy in the sky, see how they run\nI'm crying, I'm crying\nI'm crying, I'm crying\nYellow matter custard dripping from a dead dog's eye\nCrabalocker fishwife pornographic priestess\nBoy you've been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down\nI am the eggman, they are the eggmen\nI am the walrus, goo goo goo joob\nSitting in an English garden waiting for the sun\nIf the sun don't come\nYou get a tan from standing in the English rain\nI am the eggman, they are the eggmen\nI am the walrus, goo goo goo joob goo goo goo goo joob\nExpert textpert choking smokers\nDon't you think the joker laughs at you\nSee how they smile like pigs in a sty, see how they snied\nI'm crying\nSemolina pilchard climbing up the Eiffel Tower\nElementary penguin singing Hare Krishna\nMan you should have seen them kicking Edgar Alan Poe\nI am the eggman, they are the eggmen\nI am the walrus, goo goo goo joob goo goo goo goo joob\nGoo goo goo joob goo goo goo joob\nGoo goooooooo jooba jooba jooba jooba jooba jooba\nJooba jooba\nJooba jooba\nJooba jooba","url":"https://genius.com/The-beatles-revival-band-i-am-the-walrus-live-lyrics"}
