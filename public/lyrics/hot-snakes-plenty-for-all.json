{"title":"Plenty For All by Hot Snakes","lyrics":"Give notice, give away\nYour personal property\nYour illusions killing you dead\nYou deserve peace of mind for yourself\n\nSouthern California\nLet's go!\nThere's room for us all\n\nThere ain't nothing for it\nWhat else can you do\nNothing to work with\nNothing to lose\nIt is what it is\nIt ain't gonna improve\nNothing to work with\nNothing to lose\nTake it or leave it\nDo both if you choose\n\nYour patrons, your guests\nManufactured phonies\nHung up on themselves\nBring 'em all with you\nIt's all for the best\n'Cause we got space out here in the west\n\nSouthern California\nLet's go!\nThere's room for us all\n\nThere ain't nothing for it\nWhat else can you do\nNothing to work with\nNothing to lose\nIt is what it is\nIt ain't gonna improve\nNothing to work with\nNothing to lose\nTake it or leave it\nDo both if you choose","url":"https://genius.com/Hot-snakes-plenty-for-all-lyrics"}
