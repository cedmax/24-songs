  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nTime it took us\nTo where the water was\nThat’s what the water gave me\nAnd time goes quicker\nBetween the two of us\nBut oh, my love, don’t forsake me\nTake what the water gave me\n\n[Chorus]\nLay me down\nLet the only sound\nBe the overflow\nPockets full of stones\nLay me down\nLet the only sound\nBe the overflow\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd oh, poor Atlas\nThe world’s a beast of a burden\nYou’ve been holding on a long time\nAnd all this longing\nAnd the ships are left to rust\nThat’s what the water gave us\n\n[Chorus]\nSo lay me down\nLet the only sound\nBe the overflow\nPockets full of stones\nLay me down\nLet the only sound\nBe the overflow\n\n[Verse 3]\nBecause they took your loved ones\nBut returned them in exchange for you\nBut would you have it any other way?\nWould you have it any other way?\nYou couldn't have it any other way\n\n[Bridge]\nBecause she’s a cruel mistress\nAnd a bargain must be made\nBut oh, my love, don’t forget me\nWhile I let the water take me\n\n[Chorus]\nLay me down\nLet the only sound\nBe the overflow\nPockets full of stones\nLay me down\nLet the only sound\nBe the overflow\n\nSo lay me down\nLet the only sound\nBe the overflow\nPockets full of stones\nLay me down\nLet the only sound\nBe the overflow",
