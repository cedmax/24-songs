{"title":"Soon Come Soon by Young Fathers","lyrics":"Hold down beholder\nHold down beholder\nHold down beholder\nThe handle's broken\nCome get your beating\nDid I not feed you?\nYou're my boy and your god is evil\nPoint blank\nGasp for air when there's two in here\nSilent day to torture\nJoin me, comrade\nDinner with dogs and kissing sad cats\nScraps and all for the cunning rats\nDrawing blood and have a drink\nTake a shot and then shoot, shooter\nTake a shot and then shoot, shooter\nTake a shot and then shoot\n\nOh, soon come soon\nOh, soon come soon\nCome and get it\nOh, soon come soon\nOh, soon come soon\nCome and get it, come and get it\n\nTurn me up, turn me up\nSay, say, say\nBatter up, batter up\nHey, hey, hey\nHaving enough is not enough to say\nChoice is not a luxury\nOn this occasion definitely\n(Honestly, ​it is)\nGreen grasses and green grasses in green patches\nSandcastles, full throttle, something subtle\nPaper rubles inside the girdle mumbling curses\nSystem of her dancing, nothing worth liking\nLower than a bastard, classing from the Baster\nBurying the hatchet\nHow do you think she likes​ it?\nShe lay the chigger in the casket\nHow do you think she likes it?\nThrowing caution to the wind\nLetting love pass you by\nSend a note to future self\nStay awake and alert\nHear the click clang at the belts\nThe rustling in the leaves, my dear\n\nAt the instance of detonation, the temperature the meteor fire will work its way to a million degrees, as hot as the surface of the sun\nOh, soon come soon\nOh, soon come soon\nOh, soon come soon\nOh, soon come soon\nOh, soon come soon\nOh, soon come soon\nOh, soon come soon\nOh, soon come soon","url":"https://genius.com/Young-fathers-soon-come-soon-lyrics"}
