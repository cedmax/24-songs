    "lyrics": "\"Heheh\"\n\nThe one true resolve of the flame and the bullet\nIs a pile of flesh like an unmanned puppet\nA set of bones gone suddenly still\nAnd in a lab under every flag right now\nSomeone's splitting atoms, and inventing new breakfast cereals\nIn the shape of their nations borders\nAnd drawing brand new maps\nDiscreetly expanding their nations borders\n\nIt's root root root for the home team\nShout like your dad at the TV screen\nTie a dollar bill around a circus flea\nThe fee to flee what you can't see\nWell, it's root root root for the home team\nShout like your dad at the TV screen\nTie a dollar bill around a circus flea\nThe fee to flee what you can't see\nYo, I agree with glee with me\n\nSomebody told me when the bomb hits\nEverybody in a 2-mile radius will be instantly sublimated\nBut if you lay face down on the ground for some time\nAvoiding the residual ripples of heat, you might survive\nPermantly fucked up and twisted like you're always underwater refracted\nOh, but if you do go gas, there's nothing you can do if the air that was once you\nIs mingled and mashed with the kicked-up molecules of the enemys former body\nBig-kid-tested, motherfucker approved\n\nWell, root root root for the home team\nShout like your dad at the TV screen\nTie a dollar bill around a circus flea\nYo, I agree with glee with me\n\nYou put your life in the hands of the highway designers\nYour stride an unforeseen side effect\nOf the urban planners realized blueprint dream\nYou put your life in the hands of the highway designers\nYour stride an unforeseen side effect\nOf the urban planners realized blueprint dream\n\nOur font's bigger than your font. Our font- so straight, so legible, and tall and impenetrable, like a fortress, like a column, a skyscraper\nOur font will crush your font. We like our font just fine. One font under god under god under god\n\nRoot root root for the home team\nShout like your dad at the TV screen\nTie a dollar bill around a circus flea\nThe fee to flee what you can't see\n\nYou put your life in the hands of the highway designers\nYour stride an unforeseen side effect\nOf the urban planners realized blueprint dream\n\nWell, it's root root root for the home team\nShout like your dad at the TV screen\nTie a dollar bill around a circus flea\nYo, I agree with glee with me\n\nYou put your life in the hands of the highway designers\nYour stride an unforseen side effect\nOf the urban planner realized blueprint dream",
