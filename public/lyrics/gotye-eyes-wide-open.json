{"title":"Eyes Wide Open byÂ Gotye","lyrics":"With our eyes wide open, we...\nWith our eyes wide open, we...\n\nSo this is the end of the story\nEverything we had, everything we did\nIs buried in dust, and this dust is\nAll that's left of us left of us\nAnd only a few ever worried\n\nWhile the signs were clear, they had no idea\nYou just get use to livin' in fear\nOr give up, when you can't even picture your future\n\nWe walk the plank, with our eyes wide open\n\nWe walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we\n(Walk the plank, with our eyes wide open, we)\nYeah we walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we\n(Walk the plank, with our eyes wide open, we)\n\nAnd some people offered up answers\nWe made out we like we heard\nThey were only words\nThey didn't add up, to a change in the way we were living (it)\nAnd the saddest thing, is all of it could've been avoided\n\nBut it was like to stop consuming's to stop being human\nAnd why'd I make a change if you won't\nWe're all in the same, boat, stayin' afloat for the moment moment moment\n\nWe walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we\n(Walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we)\nYeah we walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we\n(We walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we)\nWe walk the plank with our eyes wide, we\nWe walk the plank with our eyes wide, we\nWe walk the plank with our eyes wide, we\nMmmm hmmm mmm\n\n(With our eyes wide open)\nWe, walk the plank, we walk the plank\n(With our eyes wide open)\nWe, walk the plank, we walk the plank, we walk the plank\n(With our eyes wide open)\nWe, walk the plank, we walk the plank\n(With our eyes wide open)\nAnd that is the end of the story","url":"https://genius.com/Gotye-eyes-wide-open-lyrics"}
