    "lyrics": "[Chorus]\nI'm a match, she's kerosene\nYou know she's gonna burn down everything\nShe's an arsonist in her pastime\nAnd I've been burned for the last time\nTime, time, time, woah\nI've been burned for the last time\nTime, time, time, woah\nI've been burned for the last time\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt started out like any other morning\nThe sky was red, he took it as a warning\nShe kicked the hive now the bees are swarming\nThen played the victim 'til the crowd starts forming\nShe's got a history of making a scene, yeah\nShe's telling stories she’s gaslighting\nLike he's the executioner and she is the queen\nBut he's the one whose neck is in a guillotine\n\n[Chorus]\nHe said, \"I'm a match, she's kerosene\nYou know she's gonna burn down everything\nShe's an arsonist in her pastime\nAnd I've been burned for the last time\"\nTime, time, time, woah\nI've been burned for the last time\nTime, time, time, woah\nI've been burned for the last time\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe smoke clears out and he's been awakened\nHe said this life could be mine for the taking\nShe needs a drink so she start shaking\nAnd play the victim 'til his heart starts breaking\nNo real tears 'cause she don't mean it\nThis landscape used to be so scenic\nAnd he could make it out if he could dream it\nRising up from the ash, he's a phoenix\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm a match, she's kerosene\nYou know she's gonna burn down everything\nShe's an arsonist in her pastime\nAnd I've been burned for the last time\nTime, time, time, woah\nI've been burned for the last time\nTime, time, time, woah\nI've been burned for the last time\n\n[Bridge]\nYou play with me, you're playing with fire\nYou play with me, you're playing with fire\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm a match, she's kerosene\nYou know she's gonna burn down everything\nShe's an arsonist in her pastime\nAnd I've been burned for the last time\nTime, time, time, woah\nI've been burned for the last time\nTime, time, time, woah\nI've been burned for the last time",
