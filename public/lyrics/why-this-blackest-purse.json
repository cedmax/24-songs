{"title":"This Blackest Purse byÂ WHY?","lyrics":"I'm not who, with my eyes from stage\nI claim to be\nI've only cradled death in my own ending\nFlesh from far off and abstracted lit\nCandle wick flickering\n\nAnd when a thing starts finishing around me\nI faint or fake a mustache, an accent, or flee\nIn fear my expired license be pulled by sheer proximity\n\nFact: the poseur in the bowler gets shot first\nThinks he's the shit 'cause he can spit and curse\nActing brash and flashing a pistol that squirts\nScowling, and shouting, \"Shall we dance?\"\n\nShould our hero's hands be holding this blackest purse?\nMom, am I failing, or worse?\nMom, am I failing?\n(Mom, am I failing?)\n\nWhat should these earnest hands be holding?\n\nStill sporting my ex-girlfriend's dead ex-boyfriend's boxers\nI want to operate from a base of hunger\nNo longer be ashamed and hide my\nTears in shower water, while I lather for pleasure\n\nI want to speak at an intimate decibel\nWith the precision of an infinite decimal\nTo listen up and send back a true echo\nOf something forever felt but never heard\n\nI want that sharpened steel of truth in every word\n\nThe small fry in the bow-tie dies first\nActing wild, like the spirit of god moving after church\nFaking he's hard like he's packed down dirt\nAlready, and yelling, \"Be my guest!\"\n\nShould our hero's hands be holding this blackest purse?\nMom, am I failing or worse?\nMom, am I failing?\n(Mom, am I failing?)\n\nWhat should these earnest hands be holding?\n\nShould our hero's hands be holding this blackest purse?\nMom, am I failing or worse?\nMom, am I failing?\n(Mom, am I failing?)\n\nWhat should these earnest hands be holding?","url":"https://genius.com/Why-this-blackest-purse-lyrics"}
