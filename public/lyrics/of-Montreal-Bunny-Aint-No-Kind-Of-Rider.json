{"title":"Bunny Ain't No Kind of Rider by ​of Montreal","lyrics":"Saw her at Go kissing girls, what a shock\nI said, \"You must be an artist.\"\nShe muttered her reply, I was judging her friend\nAs the DJ played a dead jam\nNo one wants to dance\nThey're outside smoking cigarettes\n\nMatthew was there, yes, he gave me the eye\nSaying, \"It doesn't kill to try.\"\nThen, blue lights all around\n\nEva, I'm sorry, but you will never have me\nTo me, you're just some faggy girl\nAnd I need a lover with soul power\nAnd you ain't got no soul power\n\nEva, I'm sorry, but you will never have me\nTo me, you're just some faggy girl\nAnd I need a lover with soul power\nAnd you ain't got no soul power\nNo, you ain't got no soul\n\nShe lead me outside to the church with the swing\nThere, I was her confessor\nHer come on made me blush, was her crush for the night\nUntil I screamed, \"Stop!\n\nHey, you must be aware I'm not alone\nI've got a tigress back at home\nAnd besides, you wouldn't know what to do with me.\"\n\nAnd under the blue lights you see them gossiping\nGossiping, gossiping, gossiping, gossiping\nGossiping, gossiping\n\nEva, I'm sorry, but you will never have me\nTo me, you're just some faggy girl\nAnd I need a lover with soul power\nAnd you ain't got no soul power\n\nEva, I'm sorry, but you will never have me\nTo me, you're just some faggy girl\nAnd I need a lover with soul power\nAnd you ain't got no soul power\nNo, you ain't got no soul power\n\nNo, you ain't got no soul power\nNo, you ain't got no soul power\nSay, you ain't got no soul power\nNo, you ain't got no soul","url":"https://genius.com/Of-montreal-bunny-aint-no-kind-of-rider-lyrics"}
