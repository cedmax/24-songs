{"title":"Viz by Le Tigre","lyrics":"Walk in\nGive him my name\nLooks up and down\nTakes a good look at my pecs\nPuts down the clipboard\nOpens the rope for my 'stache\nWalk in with my duffle hanging\nHat is tilted, I'm inside\nMy eyes dream of bedroom suprise\n\nThey call it climbing, and i call it visibility\nThey call it coolness, and i call it visibility\nThey call it way too rowdy, and i call it finally free\n\nTheres a girl\nHer lips have never seen\nShe comes up\nDances on me\nI look into her eyes\nI say \"Hey, you're not a dyke...\"\nShe says\n\n\"I call it climbing, and you call it visibility\nI call it coolness, and you call it visibility\nI call it way too rowdy, and you call it finally free\"\n\nTheres a slap on my back\nI find another butch, hat cocked, and we\nWe put our hands in the crowd\nAnd over and over\nWe jump up and down\n\nThey call it climbing, and we call it visibility\nThey call it coolness, and we call it visibility\nThey call it way too rowdy, and we call it finally free","url":"https://genius.com/Le-tigre-viz-lyrics"}
