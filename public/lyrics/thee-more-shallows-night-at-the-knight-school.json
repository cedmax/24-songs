{"title":"Night At The Knight School by Thee More Shallows","lyrics":"At the night school, night school\nYou doodle and you draw anything, anything\nExcept what you're taught\nYou got a bad tooth, bad tooth\nSo you clench your jaw\nAnd you concentrate, concentrate\nOn the aching cause it keeps you awake\n\nForecasters of disasters show proofs that show they're right\nBut you can block out anything\nCounting every blink of each florescent light\nIn every class on ever single last night\n\nThat's right\nThat's right\n\nAnd then the tooth breaks, tooth breaks\nYou can bite down on your tongue\nAnd keep a tight smile, tight smile\nStitched across on your practiced face\nLike it's all stupidly, stupidly right\nBut when you take down your notes each night, write lightly\nAnd then go back and erase what they say\n\nBecause they say forecasters of disasters want proof that they were right\nThey'd love to see you learn\nBut they'll have to wait for a long, long time\nYou can outlast anything\nYou'll count every blink of each florescent light\nIn every class\nOn every single last night\n\nAt the night school\nAt the night school\n\nAt the night school, night school\nYou doodle and you draw anything, anything\nExcept what you're taught\nYou got a bad tooth, bad tooth\nSo you clench your jaw\nAnd you concentrate, concentrate\nOn the aching cause it's keeping you awake","url":"https://genius.com/Thee-more-shallows-night-at-the-knight-school-lyrics"}
