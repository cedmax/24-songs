    "lyrics": "The moon kids won the war\nSnared a lonely passerby\nTo celebrate the electric chair\nOn a disappearing island\n\nBut there's no one crying over me either\n\nSo lighten up the camera flood\nEarly on, the latest feeling\nBut I don't mind your idle mind\nMuch slower than a picture\n\n'cause there's no one crying over me either\nYeah, there's no one crying over me either\n\nYou stayed up late, my roaming shut-in\nDon't belong, your luck is fleeting\nTo set aside a sunset for those\nSkinny-shaded fuckwits\n\nBut there's no one crying over them either\nLike there's no one crying over me\n\nI want it but I need it like the hole in my head\nIf the hip kids buy in\nPut another hole in my head\nCool enough to always be dead",
