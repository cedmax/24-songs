{"title":"Clash the Truth by Beach Fossils","lyrics":"Life can be so vicious\nThat we can't even appreciate its purities\nWe get so excited\nThat we can't feel any of our insecurities\nAll of what you said\nIt went right over my head and now I’m gone\nIt feels like an attack\nWhen I'm asking for it back, I know\n\nDream, rebel, trust, youth, free, life, clash, truth\nReal, time, gone through, peace, piss, shine, proof\nClash, truth, lush, you, lost time, so confused\nCharge, train, hate, proof, nothing real, nothing true","url":"https://genius.com/Beach-fossils-clash-the-truth-lyrics"}
