{"title":"Penny Lane by The Beatles","lyrics":"[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]\nIn Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs\nOf every head he's had the pleasure to know\nAnd all the people that come and go\nStop and say hello\n\n[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]\nOn the corner is a banker with a motorcar\nThe little children laugh at him behind his back\nAnd the banker never wears a mac\nIn the pouring rain\nVery strange\n\n[Chorus 1: Paul McCartney with John Lennon & George Harrison]\nPenny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes\nThere beneath the blue suburban skies\nI sit and meanwhile back\n\n[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]\nIn Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass\nAnd in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen\nHe likes to keep his fire engine clean\nIt's a clean machine\n\n[Piccolo trumpet solo]\n\n[Chorus 2: Paul McCartney with John Lennon & George Harrison]\nPenny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes\nFour of fish and finger pies\nIn summer, meanwhile back\n\n[Verse 4: Paul McCartney]\nBehind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout\nA pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray\nAnd though she feels as if she's in a play\nShe is anyway\n\n[Verse 5: Paul McCartney]\nIn Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer\nWe see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim\nAnd then the fireman rushes in\nFrom the pouring rain\nVery strange\n\n[Chorus 1: Paul McCartney with John Lennon & George Harrison]\nPenny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes\nThere beneath the blue suburban skies\nI sit, and meanwhile back\n\n[Chorus 2: Paul McCartney with John Lennon & George Harrison]\nPenny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes\nThere beneath the blue suburban skies\nPenny Lane","url":"https://genius.com/The-beatles-penny-lane-lyrics"}
