  "lyrics": "We are present\nWe are assembled\nWe're ready, so let's get started\nThe first order to attend to\nIs to get rid of who we outsmarted\nBut to do this we'll have to poison\nAll the brothers and the sisters\nMake it quick, we're on deadline\nOr we'll upset the misses and the misters\n\nWe signed up to get down\nSo what's the deal with all this waiting around?\nWe lined up on the ground\nOne year later that's how we\nWere found, alright\n\nThis meeting is adjourned\nPick up your papers and your pencils\nThis is a packet, look inside it\nThere should be keys for your car rental\nIf you listen with your ears\nYou will find out something dirty\nAnd if you fail, you'll be unhappy\nI'm barely born; they're over 30\n\nWe signed up to get down\nSo what's the deal with all this waiting around?\nWe lined up on the ground\nOne year later that's how we\nWere found, alright\n\nThey talk slow\nRepeating words that we already know\nWe talk fast\nSteal from the future and not from the past\nThey talk slow\nRepeating words that we already know\nWe talk fast\nSteal from the future and not\nFrom the past, oh yeah",
