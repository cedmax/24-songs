{"title":"These 3 Things byÂ Ought","lyrics":"When you wake up in your morning\nHead on down the river\nSee your soul\nFeel it sway\nHear the world screaming\nListen, your name\nMakes it seems like nothing could hear you\n\nYou fall back off the ledge in your mind's eye\nIt can see how you land and that's the difference\nNow proceed calmly to the edge of your road\nA narrow way that is leading you home\n\nWill I hear my soul?\nWill I hear my soul?\nWill I hear my soul?\nWill I hear my soul?\n\nYou feel your shoulder tightening\nSo you lean and sway\nIf you're made of stone, then turn into clay\nWash away my body, I don't need it\nI stop moving, slowly glisten, and hurt\n\nMary has a note for me\nI'll leave in a day\nA precious secret\nLike a bird inside a vest\nWings won't mend, so I hold them again\nIt doesn't speak, it just sings 'til it burns\n\nThen I hear my soul\nThen I hear my soul\nThen I hear my soul\nWill I hear my soul?\nWill I hear my soul?\nWill I hear my soul?\nWill I hear my soul?\nWill I hear my soul?\n\nOnly placement in the ages\nFrees me, then why can't it please me?\nAnd why must my dirty skin be hot when you come near me?\nMust remember to dance alone at night\nKeep the profane in the light\nI have only got this life\nAnd it merits this\nIt merits this\nMerits this, yeah\nMerits this, oh\n\nI must remember to dance with you tonight\nI must remember I owe my heart","url":"https://genius.com/Ought-these-3-things-lyrics"}
