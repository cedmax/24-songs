{"title":"Boys Like Me by Paul Baribeau","lyrics":"My parents made me\nIn 1980\nAnd I was born in the hot, hot summer\nI loved my parents\nMy parents loved me\nBut they just couldn't love each other\n\nBroken hearted boys like me are everywhere you look\nBroken hearted boys like me are everywhere you look\n\nI had a puppy\nI named her Odie\nBut we had to put her down last summer\nShe was my best friend\nWhen I moved to Grand Ledge\nBut she had a stroke and couldn't even walk\n\nBut broken hearted boys like me are everywhere you look\nBroken hearted boys like me are everywhere you look\n\nI had a girlfriend\nA pretty brown haired girlfriend\nBut something awful happened to us one summer\nWe both got real sad\nAnd by the spring time\nWe forgot how to love each other\n\nBroken hearted boys like me are everywhere you look\nBroken hearted boys like me are everywhere you look\n\nThere's no moral to the story\nIt's just my story and I hope I haven't wasted too much of your time\nIt's just a song I sing\nCause song singing makes me happy\nI wish that were true\nI wish everyone were happy\n\nBut broken hearted boys like me are everywhere you look\nBroken hearted boys like me are everywhere you look","url":"https://genius.com/Paul-baribeau-boys-like-me-lyrics"}
