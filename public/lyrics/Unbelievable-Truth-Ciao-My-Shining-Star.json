{"songs":"Ciao My Shining Star by Unbelievable Truth","lyrics":"Ciao my shining star\nWas all it took\nTo bring on the look you love so much\nWell i flipped out on Henry\nAnd the notes you left behind\nSo often unkind but not from you\nAnd I was making a wish\nThat you were reading this\n\nYou have taken my advantage away\nMiss popcorn well I must say\nYou take a little stumble\nWell it's understansdable my dear\nBut you can't slip right through it all\n\nWell I was always going round alone\nAnd then I bumped into you\nAnd now you just keep on bumping me back\nWell that's a big hat you have there\nAnd I have a great big head\nSo empty inside before my thoughts of you\n\nI was making a wish that you were reading this\nYou have taken my advantage away\nMiss popcorn well I must say\nYou take a little stumble\nWell it's understandable my dear\nBut you can't slip right through it all\n\nWasn't that significant\nIt was the very first time\nI lay down in the sunshine\nAnd laid away my moonshine\nThat big fat fisherman\nKeeps swimming in\nFishing for a fish\nAnd i was making a wish that you were reading this\nThat you were reading this\nI was making a wish\n\nYou have taken my advantage away\nMiss popcorn well I must say\nYou take a little stumble\nWell it's understandable my dear\nBut you can't slip right through it all\nYou have taken my advantage away\nMiss popcorn well I must say\nYou take a little stumble\nWell it's understandable my dear\nBut you can't slip right through it all\nSlip right trough it all Slip right through it all...","url":"https://genius.com/Unbelievable-truth-ciao-my-shining-star-lyrics"}
