{"title":"No Sunlight by Death Cab for Cutie","lyrics":"When I was young, lying in the grass\nI felt so safe in a warming bath\nOf sunlight\nOf sunlight\n\nVast open sky could do no harm\nLike an embrace from mother's arms\nIn sunlight\nIn sunlight\n\nIn sunlight\nIn sunlight\n\nWith every year that came to pass\nMore clouds appear until the sky went black\nAnd there was\nNo sunlight\nNo sunlight\nAnd there was\nNo sunlight\nNo sunlight anymore\n\nYou disappeared at the same speed\nThe idealistic things I believed\nThe optimist died inside of me\n\nNo sunlight\nNo sunlight\n\nNo sunlight\nNo sunlight\n\nYou disappeared at the same speed\nThe idealistic things I believed\nThe optimist died inside of me\n\nNo sunlight\nNo sunlight\n\nNo sunlight\nNo sunlight\n\nNo sunlight\nNo sunlight\nNo sunlight\nNo sunlight\nNo sunlight anymore","url":"https://genius.com/Death-cab-for-cutie-no-sunlight-lyrics"}
