{"title":"You Can Call Me Al by Paul Simon","lyrics":"A man walks down the street\nHe says, \"Why am I soft in the middle, now?\nWhy am I soft in the middle?\nThe rest of my life is so hard\nI need a photo-opportunity\nI want a shot at redemption\nDon't want to end up a cartoon\nIn a cartoon graveyard\"\nBonedigger, Bonedigger\nDogs in the moonlight\nFar away in my well-lit door\nMr. Beerbelly, Beerbelly\nGet these mutts away from me\nYou know, I don't find this stuff amusing anymore\n\nIf you'll be my bodyguard\nI can be your long lost pal\nI can call you Betty\nAnd Betty, when you call me, you can call me Al\n\nA man walks down the street\nHe says, \"Why am I short of attention?\nGot a short little span of attention\nAnd, whoa, my nights are so long\nWhere's my wife and family?\nWhat if I die here?\nWho'll be my role model\nNow that my role model is gone, gone?\"\nHe ducked back down the alley\nWith some roly-poly little bat-faced girl\nAll along, along\nThere were incidents and accidents\nThere were hints and allegations\n\nIf you'll be my bodyguard\nI can be your long lost pal\nI can call you Betty\nAnd Betty, when you call me, you can call me Al\nCall me Al\n\nA man walks down the street\nIt's a street in a strange world\nMaybe it's the third world\nMaybe it's his first time around\nDoesn't speak the language\nHe holds no currency\nHe is a foreign man\nHe is surrounded by the sound, the sound\nCattle in the marketplace\nScatterings and orphanages\nHe looks around, around\nHe sees angels in the architecture\nSpinning in infinity\nHe says, \"Amen and Hallelujah!\"\n\nIf you'll be my bodyguard\nI can be your long lost pal\nI can call you Betty\nAnd Betty, when you call me, you can call me Al\nCall me\n\nNa na na na, na na na na\nNa na na na, na na na-na na-na\nNa na na na, na-na na-na na na\nNa na na na, na na na na\n\nIf you'll be my bodyguard\nI can call you Betty\nIf you'll be my bodyguard\nI can call you Betty\nIf you'll be my bodyguard","url":"https://genius.com/Paul-simon-you-can-call-me-al-lyrics"}
