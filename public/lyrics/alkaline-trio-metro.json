{"title":"Metro by Alkaline Trio","lyrics":"I'm alone\nSitting with my empty glass\nMy four walls\nFollow me through my past\n\nI was on a Paris train\nI emerged in London rain\nAnd you were waiting there\nSwimming through apologies\n\nI remember searching for the perfect words\nI was hoping you might change your mind\nI remember a soldier sleeping next to me\nRiding on the metro\n\nYou wore white\nSmiling as you took my hand\nSo removed\nWe spoke of wintertime in France\n\nMinutes passed with shallow words\nYears have passed and still I hurt\nOh, I can see you now\nSmiling as I pulled away\n\nI remember a letter wrinkled in my hand\nI love you always filled my eyes\nI remember the night we walked along the Seine\nRiding on the metro\n\nI remember a feeling coming over me\nThe soldier turned, then looked away\nI remember hating you for loving me\nRiding on the metro\n\nI'm alone\nSitting with my broken glass\nMy four walls\nFollow me through my past\n\nI was on a Paris train\nI emerged in London rain\nAnd you were waiting there\nSwimming through apologies\n\nFuck off, asshole\n\nI remember searching for the perfect words\nI was hoping you might change your mind\nI remember a soldier sleeping next to me\nRiding on the metro","url":"https://genius.com/Alkaline-trio-metro-lyrics"}
