  "lyrics": "You are my red-eyed pea\nMy red strawberry seed\nThe peach on my family tree\nYou are my blue-eyed seed\n\nYou are my bee-like buzz\nSoft as the hummers' hum\nThe beat of the drummers' drum\nThe red of the new blue sun\n\nYou were born in golden name\nTo shake the golden out of me\nA violin of sin or swim\nOr sink or sing or just for me\n\nA water wing or guarded lover\nLove to me you'll always be\nMy dirty diamond golden eyelid\nDying right in front of me\n\nMother keep pushing, I see a crown\nThe stress from your casting is beautiful now\nGive him a blanket, he'll always be fed\nBut he'll never make it cause of all that we did\n\nWe'll give him a blood trail, give him a name\nA house in the quicksand, a parade in the rain\nA brother, a sister who'll get just the same\nAnd we'll tell them we're sorry they got hooked to our chain\n\nYou were born in golden name\nTo shake the golden out of me\nA violin of sin or swim\nOr sink or sing or just for me\n\nA water wing or guarded lover\nLove to me you'll always be\nMy dirty diamond golden eyelid\nDying right in front of me",
