    "lyrics": "What's that you see?\nThere's all these satellites, satellites, satellites\nOrbiting you and me\nJust one glimpse can change your life, change your life, change your life\nAnd you can see\nThrough all these satellites, satellites, satellites\nOrbiting you and me\nOne glimpse change your life, change your life, change your life, change it\n\nI get so haunted, I fall in your dreams tonight\nI get so haunted that I'm misunderstood tonight\n\nWhat's that you see?\nThere's all the satellites, satellites, satellites\nHaunting you and me\nJust one glimpse can change your life, change your life, change your life\nAnd you can see\nThrough all these satellites, satellites, satellites\nHaunting you and me\nOne glimpse change your life, change your life, change your life, change it\n\nThis is real, this is what you search out\nAnd you wouldn't believe, you could never say it's true\n\nYou can leave, and you could go out, search out\nHarbor daze, harbor daze\nIn a harbor daze\nIn a harbor daze",
