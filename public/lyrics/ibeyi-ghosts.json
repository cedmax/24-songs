{"title":"Ghosts byÂ Ibeyi","lyrics":"He he he he he\nWelcome to my earth\nIt's a crying shame\nWe have built a foolish world\nBusy fighting, cruelly lying and denying\n\nMy ghosts are not gone\nThey dance in the shade\nAnd kiss the black core of my heart\nMaking words, making sounds, making songs\n\nNow you can feel my heart spinning\nYou turn my whole life around\nI want to write a new beginning\nLet go of the ghosts\nLet dreams and hopes fly\nAnd give our love another try\nShould we just let it be?\n\nMake love to me\nMy ghosts are not gone\nThey kiss the black core of my heart\nMaking words making sounds making songs\n\nNow you can feel my heart spinning\nYou turn my whole life around\nI want to write a new beginning\nLet go of the ghosts\nLet dreams and hopes fly\nAnd give our love another try\nShould we just let it be?\n\nWe ain't nothing without love, without love\nWe ain't nothing without love, without love\n\nMai mai mai soronso ae\nAggayu soronso\nMai mai mai soronso ae\nAggayu soronso\nMai mai mai soronso ae\nAggayu soronso\nMai mai mai soronso ae\nMai mai mai soronso ae\nMai mai mai soronso ae","url":"https://genius.com/Ibeyi-ghosts-lyrics"}
