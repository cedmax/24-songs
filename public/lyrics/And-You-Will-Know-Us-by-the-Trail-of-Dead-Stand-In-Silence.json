{"songs":"Stand in Silence by ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead","lyrics":"I had a house on a rock\nI turned around and it had gone to rot\nAll that was left of me were walls of doubt\nI asked a question but the world returned with silence\nAll that I wanted to know is where'd everyone else go?\n\nI had a dad, and a mom\nI had a family, don't know what went wrong\nI watched them helpless as their blood turned sour\nWanted to speak for them but had to stand in silence\nAll that I wanted to know is where'd everyone else go?\n\nI had a band, had a song\nI had a vision, where's my vision gone?\nI turned inside to find the walls of doubt\nMy mind was stripped of sound, I had to stand in silence\nAll that I wanted to know is where'd everyone else go?","url":"https://genius.com/And-you-will-know-us-by-the-trail-of-dead-stand-in-silence-lyrics"}
