{"title":"Harlem by Motel Motel","lyrics":"Somewhere theres a town\nWhere the roads are covered in red and violet roses\nAnd the people sleep through a thousand years of sadness\nLord you couldnt wake them if you wanted to\nAn Indian told me\nI am older then the road I am on\nI asked him a question\nHe said no you tell me where you come from\nThen I turned to Julie\nIn a casino built in restaurant\nShe says Im lucky because Ive always had a home\nA woman to hold me\nWhen I get stoned\nI may feel lonely\nBut I dont know what its like to be alone\nUntil I see the bottom\nSomewhere theres a town\nWhere the roads are covered in red and violet roses\nAnd the people sleep through a thousand years of sadness\nLord you couldnt wake them if you wanted to\nI hope Im not there when you do\nI hope Im in some other life\nBecause I dont want to see their faces\nLooking so displaced\nSo close your eyes and say goodnight\nAn Indian told me\nI am older then the road I am on\nSo I went back to New York\nThe city where I come from\nWhere the people look at me\nLike Im somebody elses problem\nMoving back to Harlem","url":"https://genius.com/Motel-motel-harlem-lyrics"}
