{"title":"Mama, Won’t You Keep Them Castles in the Air and Burning? by  Clap Your Hands Say Yeah","lyrics":"Invisible\nlike all the reasons\nDark and cold like all the seasons\nThings are not as you would have them\nI'm no man and you're no woman\n\nI guess I hoped to see you some time\nThough our paths will never intertwine\nAgain I hope you notice\nI'm no hare and you're no tortoise\n\nAnd I'm touched by the seams\nThat I feel in the thread\nJust to know that you can\nMakes me see it\nThe idea in your head\nAnd the goblets in your hands\nOn a mission to a heart ache land\n\nSo now I'm out for political favors\nSalary that corresponds with labor\nBig house and a morning paper\nGood fences that make good neighbors\n\nI'm at the end\nThis here my rope\nAnother year to write and read the book I wrote\n\nNo dialing out\nFor a good time\nTo bathroom wall\nToss it a dime\n\nDead king dead swing\nAli look out!\nWe have new rules\nTo do without\nYou talk of Jesus\nUntil I'm well red\n\nThe man is\nSwimming\nSwimming\nSwimming in my head\n\nWhy settle down?\nWhy even try?\nMe tiger mouth\nMeet bloodless eye\n\nSo drop dead stock\nWhat fallen tree?\nI leave New York\nFor other cities\n\nWhich let me play\nWith gas and fire\nTook out an ad\nBest friend for hire\n\nKnow that Mama told me\nNever to come\nBut I came softly, slowly\nBanging me metal drum\n\nLike Berryman\nBed-wet poet fears\nThat better men drink taller beers\n\nLike scientist\nI lost my glove\nTo bloody fists\nAnd harder drugs\n\nSo split the night\nAnd we get young\nLike sacred cow\nWithout a tongue who sang a song sing\n\n\"Time does not cut deep but cuts most absurdly.....\"\n\nSo la-dee-da\nSo la-dee-da\nSo la-dee-da\nSo la-dee-da\nLa-la-dee-da\nSo la-dee-da\nSo la-dee-da\nSo la-dee-da...","url":"https://genius.com/Clap-your-hands-say-yeah-mama-wont-you-keep-them-castles-in-the-air-and-burning-lyrics"}
