{"songs":"The Far Pavilions by ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead","lyrics":"New Horizons, unclaimed lands\nAwait us beyond the walls of our cantonment\nI'll return to the Far Pavilions\nYou can't let it get you down\nYou were raised on the edge\nOf this unnamed ghost town\nThere, a million far pavilions\nGaze down from up on their heights\nWhere their eyes, full of wonder wait to greet you\nAs you rise, feel the world you know divided up\nAbove and below\nLet the roads lead you back\nTo those places you lived\nBrick fields full of cut glass\nWhere the sidewalks strangled you\nAs you cradled your friend as he died from a gun wound\nPast love and hatred lies our greatness","url":"https://genius.com/And-you-will-know-us-by-the-trail-of-dead-the-far-pavilions-lyrics"}
