{"songs":"Adultery by Little Comets","lyrics":"This is a tale of a boy of a man\nOf a girl of a wife\nFor putting your hands into trousers and knickers\nCan destroy a life\n\nTension grows the signs of cavorting\nStill cling to his clothes\nTension mounts he tells her that\nPlatonic love never counts\n\nAdultery\nAdultery\n\nIn every kitchen there's people who listen\nThrough cracks in the wall\nSo she plays the fly as he lets in his love\nThrough a sullied back door\n\nShe screams, no\nHer eyes are transparently starting to glow\nHe shouts, yes\nAnd figures that it's a good time to confess\n\nTo adultery\nAdultery\nTears in the morning\n(Adultery)\nNo sense of warning\n(Adultery)\n\nHe never said he loved her that much\nShe didn't act like she cared at all for conversation\nSo when you're living without being touched\nThere's no surprise that there will be deviation\n\nEverything's ending, there's no use pretending\nOur couple are fine\nHer love is expiring while he sits perspiring\nJust playing out time\n\nTension builds\nJust think of the children, he wills as she spills\nTears from eyes\nSo tired and blinded by subtext and lies\n\nIt's adultery\nAdultery\nTears in the morning\n(Adultery)\nNo sense of warning\n(Adultery)","url":"https://genius.com/Little-comets-adultery-lyrics"}
