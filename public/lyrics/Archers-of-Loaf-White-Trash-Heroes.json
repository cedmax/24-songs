{"songs":"White Trash Heroes by Archers of Loaf","lyrics":"Frozen out of focus, the Sunday crowd\nStarted dreaming of television turned up too loud\nCoded conversation, half baked and tired\nLeft us sleepy on blacktops burning the motor mile\n\nAnd underneath the arcade, details collide\nThere's good shopping, but all those patrons have too much style\nAnd moving in slow motion the boulevard started seething\nWith them half-ravers and techno bars\n\nDead ends lie along the neon sky\nAll speeding past collide and crashing, I'm in paradise\n\nSealed in concentration, the lantern lights\nStarted shrinking on dead men drinking white liquor wine\nAnd iced complication, the methane gas\nStarted leaking on bastards burning half red and black\n\nWe can ride along in perfect time\nAll speeding past collide and crashing, i'm in paradise\n\nAnd standing at the gates of NC state fair\nSaw you smoking with all those new friends you've got to spare\nAnd melting back in focus the Sunday crowd\nStarted sleeping with white trash heroes, tv's turned down\n\nIn their eyes, along the neon sky\nAll speeding past collide and crashing, i'm in paradise\nWe can ride along in perfect time\nAll dreaming of the white trash heroes on the boulevard\nDead ends lie along the neon sky\nAll speeding past the line and crashing on the boulevard\nWe can ride along in perfect time\nAll dreaming of the white trash heroes, i'm in paradise","url":"https://genius.com/Archers-of-loaf-white-trash-heroes-lyrics"}
