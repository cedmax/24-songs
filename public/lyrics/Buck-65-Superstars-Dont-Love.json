{"title":"Superstars Don't Love by Buck 65","lyrics":"Michael Jackson died today\nCycle's action, hideaway\nNews flash, loose cash, soft-core porn\nOrsi lying on the floor\nWhere no man has gone before\nRed meats, bed sheets, born forlorn\nWar-torn b-boys\nCybernetic decoys\nNerdy henchman, dirty Frenchman, world's on strike\nUnderground and transatlantic\nRumour mill expands the panic\nRun ragged, long legged girls on bikes\nWatch me! Karate kick! Spin the reversal\nI got the shit just like in the commercial\nWatch me! Risque! Controversial!\nLivin' life just like in the commercial\nA step ahead, ran beyond, pen and paper champion\nInk and blood, sink in mud, earn your turn\nDigging deep, source obscure\nWhat a load of horse manure\nRoxanne, Roxanne. Burn! Burn! Burn!\nNever ending, probably starting\nMemories of Dolly Parton\nParis nights and Paris sights, found my flaw\nGoose-neck, handle bar, silver ships of Andilar\nDixie jive, sixty-five, down by law\n\nSuperstars don't love, they play\nThis is how we do, everyday\n\nI feel like a million bucks\nI feel like a million bucks\nI feel like a million bucks\nI feel like a million bucks\n\nMichael Jackson! Michael Jackson! Michael Jackson!\nForever fly, severed ties\nThe king of pop will never die\nMichael Jackson! Michael Jackson! Michael Jackson!\nForever fly, severed ties\nThe king of pop will never die\n\nSituation, Guy Debord, Grand Wizard Theodore\nDistant lover, Crispin Glover, everything is fine!\nDollar bill, holy grail, you can't win, only fail\nOver oceans, Nova Scotian, every kind combined\nA lot of noise, a little peace, circumstance: middle east\nWoody Guthrie, would he trust me?\nRan a fence between\nSing the words, you know the song\nEverything you know is wrong\nRocket ships! Apocalypse! Man against machine...\n\nB-boys, warlords, outlaws, heroes, smart girls\nCowboys, poor folks, zeroes\nBookworms, weirdos, wise ones, nomads\nYoung punks, good guys, stick it to the man!\n\nSuperstars don't love, they play\nThis is how we do, everyday...\n\nFlash light\nLast night\nAss tight\nThat's right\n\nMaking friends by telephone\nLeave the kids the hell alone\nTrouble maker, double-taker, ultra pretty mom\nImitation Spiderman, hide the truth inside your hand\nRural China, girl's vagina, keep the city calm\nSuper-unapologetic, especially precocious\nForm and focus, swarm of locust\nPeril of the sun, magic words are mine to say\nLead me not, I'll find the way\nMasterpiece, Evangelista, barrel of a gun!\n\nB-boys, warlords, outlaws, heroes, smart girls\nCowboys, poor folks, zeroes\nBookworms, weirdos, wise ones, nomads\nYoung punks, good guys, stick it to the man!\n\nSuperstars don't love, they play\nThis is how we do, everyday","url":"https://genius.com/Buck-65-superstars-dont-love-lyrics"}
