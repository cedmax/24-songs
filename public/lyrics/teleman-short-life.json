{"title":"Short Life byÂ Teleman","lyrics":"Hello again, yeah, it's me again\nI said I'd be back and I'd be your friend\nPeace and love, flowers in your hair\nLook out the window, it's Jesus standing there\nTake a picture, share it online\nWhat's on the TV? It's a short life\nIt's a short little life\n\nWait a minute, this isn't right\nThe world is turning, but I'm still in the line\nChange my hair, and change my dress\nBut the feelings follow wherever you tread\nSing for money, dance if you like\nTake a picture, it's a short life\nI wanna feel alive, I wanna feel alive\n\nIt's a short life, a short life\nBurn the moment, no turning back\nIt's a short life, a short life\nBurn the moment, no looking back\nA short life underneath the same sun\nSo hold on to someone\nIt's a short life, a short life\nSo dance with someone, come on\n\nHello again, from a bad friend\nI'm good for nothing, but I'm good for something\nWhat's in my pocket, what's up my sleeve?\nYou could've pick any card, so what do you need?\nA singing monkey, dancing all night\nTake a picture, it's a short life\nIt's a short little life, I wanna feel alive\n\nIt's a short life, a short life\nBurn the moment, no turning back\nIt's a short life, a short life\nBurn the moment, no looking back\nA short life underneath the same sun\nSo hold on to someone\nIt's a short life, a short life\nSo dance with someone you like","url":"https://genius.com/Teleman-short-life-lyrics"}
