{"title":"Sentimental Man by The Dismemberment Plan","lyrics":"There is no heaven and there is no hell\nNo limbo in between\nI think it's all a lie\nJust a white light out to velvet black\nAnd back to neutral gray\nThat's all when we die\n\nThere is no fate that divides our day\nNo spirits hard at work\nNo unseen hand at play\nPeople talk like it's a given thing\nI dunno what they mean\nNor, I suspect, do they\n\nWell, I guess that's ok\n\nBut how do you know I'm not a sentimental man?\nIs it really so hard to see these things? I guess it is\nI couldn't tell you why, I think it's right there\nNobody's perfect, but I'm doing what I can\nAnd you best believe I'll keep it real\n\nI'm an old testament type of guy\nI like my coffee black\nAnd my parole denied, yeah\nEven as I flake on every deal\nI ever made with myself\nBefore the ink could dry\n\nWell, I should keep that one inside\n\nHow do you know I'm not a sentimental man?\nIs it really so hard to see these things? I guess it is\nI couldn't tell you why, I think it's PC\nCertain disaster, and I really couldn't say\nHow the fuck I could let this get so far\n\nOh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nOh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nHow do you know that I'm not your biggest fan?\nCan you really make that case so clear? I think you can't\nI don't know why you try, I guess it's all a game\nI'm under the covers and I'm telling you good night\nCause I plan to have some real fine dreams","url":"https://genius.com/The-dismemberment-plan-sentimental-man-lyrics"}
