{"songs":"Submarines by ​The Lumineers","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nI believe submarines\nUnderneath deep blue sea\nSaw the flags, Japanese\nNo one will believe me\nRan back to the town bar\nAnd I told the people how\nI had seen a submarine\nAnd everyone laughed aloud\n\n[Verse 2]\nI did spy a periscope\nDead of night on the eastern coast\nThe police made them jokes\nTold me I’d seen a ghost\nEveryone thinks I’m a liar\nNo one knows the truth\nIf it was a bigger fire\nI would be on the roof\n\n[Interlude]\nShips will rust in Baldwin Bay\n(Let me go)\nNo one trusts what I say\n(I don’t know)\nOh my god, no one paid (attention)\nOvernight my hair turned gray\n(Oh oh oh)\nIn the end it boils down to credibility\nI had none, so I will die with the secrets of the sea\n\n(Submarine)\n(Can't find me)\nSubmarine\n(Submarine)","url":"https://genius.com/The-lumineers-submarines-lyrics"}
