{"songs":"Roads? Where We're Going We Don't Need Roads by Marnie Stern","lyrics":"I present two sides\nMy hopelessness and my faith\nMy ego and my heart\nMy feelings and my brain\n\nYou've risen to that place you have\nWe're in the big tower, I'm holding your hand\nAnd of all the things I want to be\nI render illusion, illusion is calling\nThere's something here in this dark scene\nI can't find what's real but I know it's in me\nAnd with pressure for delivery\nI render illusion illusion is calling me up\n\nYou said to create a place that feels like we are moving\nBut I live in this dream of maps and I keep on searching, looking\nFor the one that gets things grooving\nStars can be really hard to draw\nIf you don't know where they are\nThat crazy star field will leave you too far\n\nYou've given to that place you have\nYou're running through hours, and hiding your hands\nAnd of all the things I want to see\nI render illusion, illusion is calling\nWell something's here on this dark street\nI can't find what's real but I know it's a beat\nAnd with pressure for delivery\nI render illusion, illusion is calling me up\n\nYou can go higher\nAnd then you don't\nYou can go higher\nAnd then you don't\n\nI had a dream I crawled all around on the high road","url":"https://genius.com/Marnie-stern-roads-where-were-going-we-dont-need-roads-lyrics"}
