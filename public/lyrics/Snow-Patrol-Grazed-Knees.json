{"title":"Grazed Knees by Snow Patrol","lyrics":"I'm trying not to stare, it's too late\nThe blanket's over there, if you like\nI'm broken and I'm colder than hell\nI should've said I'd not come back here\n\nYour breakfast will get cold\nI really have to go\n\nIt's easier to lie and be safe\nTime and time again I'm half stalled\nOne giant leap of faith is easy\nWhen everyone you ask is so sure\n\nJust give a second thought\nWhat if we don't get caught\n\nJust say you love me now\nAnd forget this whole row\nJust save your energy\nFor making up with me","url":"https://genius.com/Snow-patrol-grazed-knees-lyrics"}
