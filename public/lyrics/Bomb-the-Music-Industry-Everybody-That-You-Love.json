{"songs":"Everybody That You Love by Bomb the Music Industry!","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nThey're looking at me with their glassy eyes, they're gonna bury me\nDripping with Hennessy and ecstasy, they're gonna bury me\nI guess I probably should have done my research\nHey!\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I know that it's darkest before dawn\n'Cause I've been staying up for way too long\nAnd I know that it only takes one call\nBut we've got no options\n\n[Verse 2]\nSome people can fake it, but my arms are weak. My hands are shaky. No one's scared of me\nTrying to keep the kamikazes still they're gonna bury me\nI guess I should have watched where I was pissing instead of off the rocks\nOf an abandoned Greenpoint dock\nWe had such an awesome night and getting shanked would be a disappointment\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I understand the calm before the storm because\nI like to hang out where it's warm\nAnd I know that it's darkest before dawn\nBut I see clearly. Oh, I get it now\n\n[Bridge]\nAll the people I love the best\nAre starting to get frustrated with me being a mess\nAnd the people I kinda hate are always depressed\nAll the people I love the best\nHave grown increasingly impatient with the person I am\nAnd some people I hardly know will never understand\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I know that it's darkest before dawn\n'cause I've been staying up for way too long\nAnd even if I never get to call, I still loved you\nHope you loved me too\n\n[Outro]\nThey're gonna bury me\nThey're gonna bury me\nThey're gonna bury me\nThey're gonna bury me","url":"https://genius.com/Bomb-the-music-industry-everybody-that-you-love-lyrics"}
