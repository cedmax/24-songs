    "lyrics": "And it's prejudice\nAs if he chose to be this way\nThey'll make him keep more than he would take\n\nOne summer morning\nHe left us ashamed\nIn some small town of small ways\nThe one they feared\nThey might turn to stone\nThey feared to hold his hand\nAnd he died alone\nHe died alone\n\nThey might turn to stone... alone\n\nDon't leave them on an island of shame\n\nYour solution\nYou homophobic\nYou coward\nYou send them away to an island of misery\nYou're not immune to any disease\nI can not argue when the truth is plain to see\nIn your beliefs, your fear of death\nI see reflections of society\nWe'll take our last breath alone\nDon't leave them on an island of shame\n\nOpen your eyes\nIt's all in sight\nAdding insult to injury\n'Cause deep inside\nThe truth in lies\nIt's not that blind\nHe was alone\n\nAnd it's prejudice\nAs if he chose to be this way\nThey'll make him keep more than he would take\nIt's prejudice\nYes it's prejudice\nAs if he chose to be this way\nThey'll make him keep more than he would take\nThey like to stab him in the back",
