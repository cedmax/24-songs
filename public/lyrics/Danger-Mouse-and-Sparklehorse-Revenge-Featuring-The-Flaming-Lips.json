{"title":"Revenge by Danger Mouse & Sparklehorse (Ft. The Flaming Lips)","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nPain\nI guess it's a matter of sensation\nBut somehow, you have a way of avoiding it all\nIn my mind, I have shot you and stabbed you through your heart\nI just didn't understand, the ricochet is the second part\n\n[Chorus]\nCause you can't hide what you intend\nIt glows in the dark\nOnce you start the path of revenge\nThere's no way to stop\nAnd the more I try to hurt you, the more it hurts me\n\n[Verse 2]\nStrange, it seems like a character mutation\nThough I have all the means of bringing you fuckers down\nI can make myself to destroy upon command\nSomehow forgiveness lets the evil make the laws\n\n[Chorus]\nNo you can't hide what you intend\nIt glows in the dark\nOnce we become the thing we dread\nThere's no way to stop\nAnd the more I try to hurt you, the more it backfires\n\n[Outro]\nThe more it backfires\nThe more it backfires","url":"https://genius.com/Danger-mouse-and-sparklehorse-revenge-lyrics"}
