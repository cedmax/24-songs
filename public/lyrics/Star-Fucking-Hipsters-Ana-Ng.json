{"title":"Ana Ng by Star Fucking Hipsters","lyrics":"Make a hole with a gun perpendicular\nTo the name of this town in a desk-top globe\nExit wound in a foreign nation\nShowing the home of the one this was written for\n\nMy apartment looks upside down from there\nWater spirals the wrong way the sink\nAnd her voice is a backwards record\nIt's like a whirlpool and it never ends\n\nAna Ng and I are getting old\nAnd we still haven't walked in the glow of each others majestic presence\nListen Ana hear my words\nThey're the ones you would think I would say if there was a me for you\n\nAll alone at the '64 World's Fair\nEighty dolls yelling \"Small girl after all\"\nWho was at the DuPont Pavilion?\nWhy was the bench still warm? Who has been there?\n\nOr the time when the storm tangled up the wire\nTo the horn on the pole at the bus depot\nAnd in the back of the edge of hearing\nThese are the words the voice was repeating:\n\nAna Ng and I are getting old\nAnd we still haven't walked in the glow of each others majestic presence\nListen Ana hear my words\nThey're the ones you would think I would say if there was a me for you\n\nWhen I was driving once I saw this painted on a bridge:\n\"I don't want the world, I just want your half\"\n\nThey don't need me here, and I know you're there\nWhere the world goes by like the humid air\nAnd it sticks like a broken record\nEverything sticks like a broken record\nEverything sticks until it goes away\nAnd the truth is, we don't know anything\n\nAna Ng and I are getting old\nAnd we still haven't walked in the glow of each other's majestic presence\nListen Ana hear my words\nThey're the ones you would think I would say if there was a me for you\n\nAna Ng and I are getting old\nAnd we still haven't walked in the glow of each other's majestic presence\nListen Ana hear my words\nThey're the ones you would think I would say if there was a me for you\n\nAna Ng and I are getting old\nAnd we still haven't walked in the glow of each other's majestic presence\nListen Ana hear my words\nThey're the ones you would think I would say if there was a me for you","url":"https://genius.com/Star-fucking-hipsters-ana-ng-lyrics"}
