{"title":"The Suburbs by Arcade Fire","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nIn the suburbs, I, I learned to drive\nAnd you told me we'd never survive\nGrab your mother's keys, we're leaving\nYou always seemed so sure\nThat one day we'd be fighting in a suburban war\nYour part of town against mine\nI saw you standing on the opposite shore\nBut by the time the first bombs fell\nWe were already bored\nWe were already, already bored\n\n[Chorus]\nSometimes I can't believe it\nI'm moving past the feeling\nSometimes I can't believe it\nI'm moving past the feeling again\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe kids want to be so hard\nBut in my dreams, we're still screaming\nAnd running through the yard\nAnd all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall\nAnd all of the houses they built in the seventies finally fall\nMeant nothing at all\nMeant nothing at all, it meant nothing\n\n[Chorus]\nSometimes I can't believe it\nI'm moving past the feeling\nSometimes I can't believe it\nI'm moving past the feeling and into the night\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo can you understand\nWhy I want a daughter while I'm still young?\nI want to hold her hand\nAnd show her some beauty before this damage is done\nBut if it's too much to ask, if it's too much to ask\nThen send me a son\nUnder the overpass\nIn the parking lot we're still waiting, it's already passed\nSo move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass\n'Cause it's already passed\nIt's already, already passed\n\n[Chorus]\nSometimes I can't believe it\nI'm moving past the feeling\nSometimes I can't believe it\nI'm moving past the feeling again\nI'm moving past the feeling\nI'm moving past the feeling\n\n[Outro]\nIn my dreams we're still screaming\nWe're still screaming\nWe're still screaming","url":"https://genius.com/Arcade-fire-the-suburbs-lyrics"}
