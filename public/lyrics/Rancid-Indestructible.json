{"songs":"Indestructible byÂ Rancid","lyrics":"And I know, I'm indestructible\nAnd I know, I'm indestructible\nTonight!\n\nBreakdown! Come on tell me it's not true\nIt's a shakedown! Come on tell me who are you\nIt's so fake now, everything I see right through\nI'm ashamed now to say I ever know you\nSee, the Great Athenians, man, they're not even from Athens\nAnd the kid from Avenue \"A\", man, he ain't even from Manhattan\nAnd uh, nothing is what it seems so I'll, I'll just stand here laughing\nI'm gonna keep on going though, I can't get distracted\n\nAnd I know, I'm indestructible\nAnd I know, I'm indestructible\nTonight!\n\nPlayback Rock and Roll come and save me\nIt's a safe bet that you will never ever betray me\nAnd I'll give back everything that you gave me\nAnd I know that no one can ever ever contain me\nAnd I won't get bogged down like some American consumer, nah\nAnd I'm dancing now to a whole different drummer\nAnd I'll keep listening to the great Joe Strummer\n'Cause through music, we can live forever\n\nAnd I know, I'm indestructible\nAnd I know, I'm indestructible\nTonight!","url":"https://genius.com/Rancid-indestructible-lyrics"}
