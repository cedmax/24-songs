{"title":"Hysterical by Clap Your Hands Say Yeah","lyrics":"Here comes the newest apparition\nTo set fire to all the flowers\nNow I should have known it was you who would call\nWhen vainly I escaped into the ever-changing rapids\nTo your boat with a sign which read \"get in and hold on.\"\n\nHysterical\nCalls for luck\nHeal the weak\nWe should just grow up\n\nAnd so I hid behind the dishes in the night\nUntil you woke to find me trembling like an emasculated dog\nThere is no sense in even trying to track the weather pattern\nIs it better to leave than to blindly hold on?\n\nHysterical . . \n\nLet me out\nOf the rain\nLet me down\nI want to make my last mistake\n\nHysterical . .","url":"https://genius.com/Clap-your-hands-say-yeah-hysterical-lyrics"}
