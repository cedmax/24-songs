    "lyrics": "You don't throw your life away going inside\nYou get to know who's watchin' you and who besides you resides\nIn your body where you're slow where you go doesn't matter\n'Cause there will come a time when time goes out the window\n\nAnd you'll learn to drive out of focus\nI'm you and if anything unfolds, it's supposed to\nOoh\n\nYou don't throw your time away sitting still\nI'm in a chain of memories, it's my will\nAnd I had to consult some figures of the past\nAnd I know someone after me will go right back\n\nI'm not telling a view\nI've got this night to unglue\nI moved this fight away\nBy doing things there's no reason to do",
