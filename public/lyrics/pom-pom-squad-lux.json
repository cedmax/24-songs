    "lyrics": "I've got a sinking suspicion\nIt might be something in your tone\nThat you would leave me here\nTo find my own way home\nYou can take my peace\nLeave me rotting like the leaves\nBut I won't ever let you say\nYou cared about me\n\nHa\nMy collar in your fist\nPulling me into your kiss\nAnd suddenly I knew my body\nWas not my own\nYou push and I give way\nCollapsing inward like a cave\nAnd I feel naked without taking off\nAny of my clothes\nWoah\n\nIn a crowded high school dance\nIn a cloud of peach alcohol\nI let myself get drunk on the idea\nThat you loved mе\n'Cause in here I'm suffocating\nBut out thеre I feel so small\nWhat a wonder to be anything at all\n\nWhen I hear your pretty words\nI should be listening to the sound\nOf my feet against the ground\nIn the opposite direction\nHow do you expect me\nTo figure myself out\nWhen I can not tell the difference\nBetween bad and good attention?\n\nEverybody telling me\nThat \"life goes on\"\nMeet me tonight in the garage\nI'll show everybody\nTelling me that \"life goes on\"\nMeet me tonight in the garage\nMeet me tonight in the garage\nUh",
