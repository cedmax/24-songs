{"title":"I Am Disappeared by Frank Turner","lyrics":"[Intro]\nI keep having dreams\nOf pioneers and pirate ships and Bob Dylan\nOf people wrapped up tight in the things that will kill them\nOf being trapped in a lift plunging straight to the bottom\nOf open seas and ways of life we've forgotten\nI keep having dreams\n\n[Verse 1]\nAmy worked in a bar in Exeter\nI went back to her house and I slept beside her\nShe woke up screaming in the middle of the night\nTerrified of her own insides\nDreams of pirate ships and Patty Hearst\nBreaking through a life over-rehearsed\nShe can't remember which came first\nThe house, the home, or the terrible thirst\nShe keeps having dreams\n\n[Bridge 1]\nAnd on the worst days\nWhen it feels like life weighs\nTen thousand tons\nShe's got her cowboy boots and\nCar keys on the bedstand\nSo she can always run\nShe could get up, shower, and in half an hour she'll be gone\n\n[Verse 2]\nI keep having dreams of things I need to do\nAnd waking up but not following through\nBut it feels like I haven't slept at all\nWhen I wake to a silence and she's facing the wall\nPosters of Dylan and of Hemingway\nAn antique compass for a sailor's escape\nShe says, \\\"You just can't live this way\\\"\nAnd I close my eyes and I never say\nI'm still having dreams\n\n[Bridge 2]\nAnd on the worst days\nWhen it feels like life weighs\nTen thousand tonnes\nI sleep with my passport\nOne eye on the back door\nSo I can always run\nI can get up, shower, and in half an hour I'll be gone\n\n[Outro]\nAnd come morning\nI am disappeared\nJust an imprint on the bedsheets\nI'm by the roadside with my thumb out\nA car pulls up, and Bob's driving\nAnd so I climb in, we don't say a word\nAs we pull off into the sunrise\nAnd these rivers of tarmac\nAre like arteries across the country\nWe are blood cells alive in\nThe bloodstream at\nThe beating heart of the country\nWe are electric pulses\nIn the pathways of the sleeping soul of the country\nWe are electric pulses\nIn the pathways of the sleeping soul of the country\n(We are electric)\nIn the sleeping soul of the country\n(Sleeping soul of the country)\nSleeping soul of the country","url":"https://genius.com/Frank-turner-i-am-disappeared-lyrics"}
