{"songs":"4AM byÂ Antemasque","lyrics":"Four AM and I hear that cry\nLook through the curtain but no sign of life\nShe stumbles, knocking over\nAll the secrets she hides\nAnd silently sweeps it all under the rug\nHow many times times have I heard that sound?\nThe hair on the back of my neck stands tall\nEverybody slowly starts closing the blinds\nAm I the only one who can recognize?\n\nI hope I never become him\nStuck behind the morning light\nI'm held in uncertain bondage, yeah\n\nWatching, waiting\nBlack and white surveillance\nI hope that nothing's going wrong\nI hope that nothing's going wrong\n\nAnd when he sees me look him eye-to-eye\nOnly on the off-hand chance that he strikes\nA pantomime motion where I am\nMiscast a play in the antemasque\n\nI hope I never become him\nStuck behind the morning light\nI'm held in uncertain bondage, yeah\n\nWatching, waiting\nBlack and white surveillance\nI hope that nothing's going wrong\nI hope that nothing's going wrong\n\nWatching, waiting\nBlack and white surveillance\nI hope that nothing's going wrong\nI hope that nothing's going wrong\n\nSharp shocked\nYeah I'm gonna put him\nNever looking back\nI'm never looking back\nSharp shocked\nYeah I'm gonna put him\nNever looking back\nI'm ever looking back\nSharp shatter\nBreak that mirror\nNever looking back\nI'm never looking back\nYeah I'm never looking back\n\nWatching, waiting\nBlack and white surveillance\nI hope that nothing's going wrong\nI hope that nothing's going wrong\n\nWatching, waiting\nBlack and white surveillance\nI hope that nothing's going wrong\nI hope that nothing's going wrong","url":"https://genius.com/Antemasque-4am-lyrics"}
