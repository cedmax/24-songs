{"title":"Ceramic Tile by Sincere Engineer","lyrics":"[Chorus]\nCeramic tile in the bathroom\nYou make me dizzy on this drunken afternoon\nBut you're cold against my face\nWhen I lie down on top of you\nMy broken smile in the bathroom\nMy mouth is bleeding and this day started too soon\nI welcome forehead kisses from the floor\nI said, \"For real. This time, no more.\"\nLike I usually do\nLike I usually do\n\n[Verse]\nI'm looking at my face\nThrough toothpaste splatters on the bathroom mirror\nI feel like shit and I hope I disappear\nBlood cells float around below me in the bathroom sink\nWith some spit and Sprite and vodka\nAnd I'm wondering why I feel so weak\n\n[Chorus]\nCeramic tile in the bathroom\nYou make me dizzy on this drunken afternoon\nBut you're cold against my face\nWhen I lie down on top of you\nMy broken smile in the bathroom\nMy mouth is bleeding and the sun came up too soon\nI welcome forehead kisses from the floor\nI said, \"For real. This time, no more.\"\nLike I usually do-o-o-o-o","url":"https://genius.com/Sincere-engineer-ceramic-tile-lyrics"}
