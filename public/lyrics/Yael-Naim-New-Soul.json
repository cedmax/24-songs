{"songs":"New Soul by Yael Naim","lyrics":"[Chorus: Yael Naim]\nI'm a new soul\nI came to this strange world\nHoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take\nBut since I came here\nFelt the joy and the fear\nFinding myself making every possible mistake\n\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm a young soul in this very strange world\nHoping I could learn a bit bout what is true and fake\nBut why all this hate?\nTry to communicate\nFinding trust and love is not always easy to make\n\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...\n\n[Bridge]\nThis is a happy end\nCause' you don't understand\nEverything you have done\nWhy's everything so wrong\nThis is a happy end\nCome and give me your hand\nI'll take your far away\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm a new soul\nI came to this strange world\nHoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take\nBut since I came here\nFelt the joy and the fear\nFinding myself making every possible mistake\n\n[Outro]\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la....\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la....\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la....\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la....","url":"https://genius.com/Yael-naim-new-soul-lyrics"}
