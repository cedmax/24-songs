{"title":"Fantasy Baseball at the End of the World by John K. Samson","lyrics":"I manage my fantasy baseball team better\nThan I manage my anger these days\nAnd I'd trade my best pitcher\nFor a draft pick and a picture\nOf the president writhing in pain\n\nIt's a weird thing to wish for, but I can't stop wishing\nRefreshing the browser, someday\nIf I live long enough\nAnd the world doesn't end\nMy wish will come true in a way\n\nAnd he'll die like we all die\nIn pain or asleep\nAnd we'll still have our fantasy baseball\nAnd the next fascist fucker in line for the job\nOf demolishing hope for us all\n\nSo I'm putting in love now, I'm putting in faith\nPutting fear on a long term IL\nI'm going outside, I'm gonna help organize\nSomething better, something beautiful","url":"https://genius.com/John-k-samson-fantasy-baseball-at-the-end-of-the-world-lyrics"}
