{"title":"20 Below by Teen Idols","lyrics":"It's warm out tonight, but I'm freezing\nShe said she's moving out, but there's just no good reason\nI tried to tell her not to go\nI turned the fire up, but it's still twenty below\n\nWhatever happened to the girl I used to know?\n'Cause her sunny summer breeze\nTurned to frigid blasts of ice and snow\nHer stares are ice, and her shoulder's turning cold\nWhat did I do to make her mercury start dropping low?\n\nIt's not the first time that he's lied to me before\nBut I know I've had enough\nI won't listen to him anymore\nIf he wants someone else, why won't he tell me so?\n'Cause I'm left out in the cold\nAnd the temperature is twenty below\n\nCold showers warm me up from nights we spent in bed\nThat's not lipstick on my collar\nAnd I don't know any pretty redheads\nHer accusations send cold chills up my spine\nAnd I'll always tell the truth\nBecause melted snowmen never lie\n\nIt's not the first time that he's lied to me before\nBut I know I've had enough\nI won't listen to him anymore\nIf he wants someone else why won't he tell me so?\n'Cause I'm left out in the cold\nAnd the temperature is twenty below\n\nTwenty below, our love is freezing\nWhy should we carry on if there's just no good reason?\nOur frozen tears have turned to snow\nMy love can't make a spark when your heart's twenty below...","url":"https://genius.com/Teen-idols-20-below-lyrics"}
