{"title":"I Will Wait by Mumford & Sons","lyrics":"Well I came home\nLike a stone\nAnd I fell heavy into your arms\nThese days of dust\nWhich we've known\nWill blow away with this new sun\n\nAnd I'll kneel down\nWait for now\nAnd I'll kneel down\nKnow my ground\n\nAnd I will wait, I will wait for you\nAnd I will wait, I will wait for you\n\nSo break my step\nAnd relent\nWell you forgave and I won't forget\nKnow what we've seen\nAnd him with less\nNow in some way\nShake the excess\n\n'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you\nAnd I will wait, I will wait for you\nAnd I will wait, I will wait for you\nAnd I will wait, I will wait for you\n\nSo I'll be bold\nAs well as strong\nAnd use my head alongside my heart\nSo tame my flesh\nAnd fix my eyes\nA tethered mind, freed from the lies\n\nBut I'll kneel down\nWait for now\nI'll kneel down\nKnow my ground\nRaise my hands\nPaint my spirit gold\nAnd bow my head\nKeep my heart slow\n\n'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you\nAnd I will wait, I will wait for you\nAnd I will wait, I will wait for you\nAnd I will wait, I will wait for you","url":"https://genius.com/Mumford-and-sons-i-will-wait-lyrics"}
