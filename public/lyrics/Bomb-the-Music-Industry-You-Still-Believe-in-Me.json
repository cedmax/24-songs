{"songs":"You Still Believe In Me? by Bomb the Music Industry!","lyrics":"I came in from the storm and the television's on\nAs celebrities enact fictionalized tales\nHow could my boring life compete?\n\nAnd I thought about the drugs\nHow I thought they fixed my brain\nUntil I was in the dark\nRattling containers, scribbling garbage to myself:\n\nI need constant attention or else I'm gonna get distracted\nBut even if you tell me something I can't guarantee I'm listening\nI hear \"BA BA BA BA BA\"\n\nI've never been in love but I saw Brian Wilson once\nI was drunk and screamed too loud over the falsetto in \"You Still Believe in Me.\"\nAnd I thought about the way his catastrophes made everything okay\n'till I watched the fire fade and former dayglo embers turned to ashy greys and blacks\nOne exhausted triple encore, unplugged bass around his neck\nI know fires can last forever, but I need to find a match cause these days, fuck, I'm tired\n\nI used to be an awesome listener\nBut now I just drift in and out or get pulled away by beats and measures\nLike I don' t have a choice but failure and running from a brighter future\n\nIt's never take me back cause I'm not sorry\nFor all the times I ran away or wasted my vacation days\nIt's something I can't bring myself to say\n\nI need constant attention or else I'm gonna get distracted\nBut even if you tell me something I can't guarantee I'm listening\nAnd these days, fuck, I'm tired\nI used to be an awesome listener\nBut now I just drift in and out or get pulled away by beats and measures\nLike I don' t have a choice but failure and running from a brighter future\n\nAnd all the times I ran away or wasted my vacation days\nIt's something I can't bring myself to say","url":"https://genius.com/Bomb-the-music-industry-you-still-believe-in-me-lyrics"}
