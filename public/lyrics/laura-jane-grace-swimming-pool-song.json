{"title":"The Swimming Pool Song by Laura Jane Grace","lyrics":"I am a haunted swimming pool\nI am emptied out and drained\nMy capacity remains unchanged\n\nI am a haunted swimming pool\nI am emptied out and drained\nMy capacity remains unchanged\n\nI don't know the source of my faith\nBut I know I will be full again\nCome on in and take a swim\n\nI am a burning church\nI am artifice and years collapsing\nI have not yet become all that I will be\n\nI am a burning church\nI am artifice and years collapsing\nI have not yet become all that I will be\n\nAnd when my body has been spent my soul here will remain\nGraffiti on a wall for all eyes to see\nThis only feels like the death of evеrything","url":"https://genius.com/Laura-jane-grace-the-swimming-pool-song-lyrics"}
