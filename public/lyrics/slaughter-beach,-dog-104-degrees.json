{"title":"104 Degrees by Slaughter Beach, Dog","lyrics":"I saw her in a dream\nExiting the bookstore lobby\nSitting on a bench on Baltimore and reading Murakami\nSlipping salt beneath the sun\nHer hands now tying up her hair\nOne pair of deeply tinted shades reflects my unbelieving stare\nAnd at once\nI am taken\n\nShe asked me what I wanted\nAs if one ever really knew\nAnd I said, \"Dull domestication, free from pressure to pursue\nAnother love, another touch, another tired conversation\"\nAnd then she shut her novel sharply\nAnd proposed a new location\nAnd at once\nI obliged\n\nDetails for a new protest\nAdorn white printer paper flyers\nShe says, \"I feel so old admitting counter-culture makes me tired\"\nShe leads me into the café\nHer intention is exact\nIt is 104 degrees\nShe takes her coffee hot and black\nAnd at once\nI am entranced\n\nShe suggests we settle down\nMeaning, settle down for good\nShe knows the perfect place on Martha Street\nIn her old neighborhood\nAnd then a taxi sounds a horn\nAnd it is full of all our things\nAnd it is parked outside the café\nAnd the driver sounds incredibly\nImpatient\n\nWhen we merge onto the freeway\nShe rolls her window down completely\nThe driver dials into a station\nAnd then she smiles at me discreetly\nShe says, \"I love this song\"\nThen turns away and tracks the clouds\nThe driver curses with conviction\nWhile \"Heavy Metal Drummer\" plays us out","url":"https://genius.com/Slaughter-beach-dog-104-degrees-lyrics"}
