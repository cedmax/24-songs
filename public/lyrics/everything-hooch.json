{"title":"Hooch byÂ Everything","lyrics":"[Hook]\nWho got the hooch\nWho got the hooch\nWho got the only sweetest thing in the world\n\n[Verse 1]\nThe working day was long\nAnd the road is grinding on\nAnd your body's winding down again\nThe tribal fire's here\nAnd the circle speaks so near\nAnd the simple truth so very much clearer\n\n[Hook]\nWho got the hooch, baby\nWho got the only sweetest thing in the world\nWho got the love, who got the fresh-e-freshy\nWho got the only sweetest thing in the world\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe birds and bees will sing\nThe jams begin to ring\nThe good vibes flow from me to you\nThe evening turns to night\nThe fire and moonlight\nThe dance of all who came before\n\n[Hook]\nWho got the hooch, baby\nWho got the only sweetest thing in the world\nWho got the love, who got the fresh-e-freshy\nWho got the only sweetest thing in the world\n\n[Verse 3]\nLet's get real, let's get heavy\nTill the water breaks the levee\nLet's get loose, loose, who got the hooch","url":"https://genius.com/Everything-hooch-lyrics"}
