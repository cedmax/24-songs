{"title":"Preachers by Petrol Girls","lyrics":"There's a lot of preachers here\nBut I don't see no saints\nLot of fingers pointing\nPalms sweating under red paint\n\nAll us curtain twitchers viewing pictures\nFling them windows wide\nThe screen's unreflective, no perspective\nIs there guilt inside?\nFeeling dead important in the comments\nTakes like tsss, we're on fire!\n\nDamned if they do, damned if he don't\nMaybe she will, what if I won't?\n\nQuick, punish each other, don't discover\nThе pattern, repeat it\nForgеt all the nuance 'cause we're fluent\nIn carceral logic\nHold the women higher, shoot them faster\n'Cause the men can't help it\n\nDamned if she do, damned if we don't\nDamned if I do, damned if you don't\n\nI don't wanna be saved\nI guess I'll be damned\nI don't wanna be saved\nI guess I'll be damned\nI don't wanna be saved\nI guess I'll be damned\nI don't wanna be saved\nI guess I'll be damned\n\nMr Sanctimony and his pony\nOnly know that one trick\nCalls it liberation, mans his station\nNever budges from it\nOur mental exhaustion fuels their fortune\nIn the silicone pit\n\nDamned if we do, damned if they don't\nMaybe he will, what if she won't?\n\nDamned if you do, damned if I don't\n\nI don't wanna be saved\nI guess I'll be damned\nI don't wanna be saved\nI guess I'll be damned\nI don't wanna be saved\nI guess I'll be damned\nI don't wanna be saved\nI guess I'll be damned\nI guess I'll be damned\nI guess I'll be damned\nI guess I'll be damned\nI guess I'll be","url":"https://genius.com/Petrol-girls-preachers-lyrics"}
