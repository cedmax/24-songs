    "lyrics": "Here we go\nLeave it on the back burner\nTake it to the dry town\n\nI got the mean time slippin' down\nThe slide some uptight right wing\nPolitical homicide, do what you want\nTake what you will, take it in like a\nSouthpaw, flip it on the grill\nBourgeoise, protocol\nBottoms up boys this is the last call\nHappy hour doesn't last too long\nYou know it never does\nSo I sit here on a bar stool looking at\nThe sky got a buck and a quarter\nAnd a bucket full or rye\nDon't step out of line you'll get time\nIn the brig don't yield to the mighty\nYou got your own dirt to dig\n\nMy and my flea bag friends we ran\nTo have our own feast of Crispan\nMurphy was there with number 22\nThey were got caught in the middle\nOf a coup, you will\nLose me if I don't lose you\n\nWe haven't chosen\nAnyone of you to condemn\nSo make your decision and chose you\nSide or let us begin\n\nSteeped in knowledge\nI'll step from the board\nDown to the speak easy\nWith my double-edged sword\nYou know the deal\nYou got to spin the wheel\nI heard the heavens are full of sevens\nBut as matter of fact\nYou know that cat suicide jack\nHe don't play like that\nTruth is he don't really play at all",
