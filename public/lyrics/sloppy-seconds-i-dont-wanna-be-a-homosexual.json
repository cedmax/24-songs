Did you fool with any of them?\"\n[Gator:] \"Aunt Ida, you know I dig women.\"\n[Aunt Ida:] \"Aw, don't tell me that.\"\n[Gator:] \"Christ, let's not go through this again.\"\n[Aunt Ida:] \"All those beauticians, and you don't have any boy dates?\"\n[Gator:] \"I don't want any boy dates.\"\n[Aunt Ida:] \"Oh honey, I'd be so happy if you turned nelly.\"\n[Gator:] \"Hey, no way. I'm straight. I mean I like a lot of queers, but I don't dig their equipment, y'know? I like women.\"\n[Aunt Ida:] \"But you can change. Queers are just better. I'd be so proud if you was a fag, and had a nice beautician boyfriend. I'd never have to worry.\"\n[Gator:] \"There ain't nothing to worry about.\"\n[Aunt Ida:] \"I'm worried that you'll work in an office, get married, have children, celebrate wedding anniversaries. The world of heterosexuals is a sick and boring life.\"\n[Gator:] \"Sometimes I think you're fucking crazy. I'm real happy just the way I am.\"\n\nPeople are telling me\nThat I'm missing out on the fun\n'Cause I don't go anywhere\nAnd I don't meet anyone\nBut I know how rumors fly\nWhen you're a lonely guy\nAnd I'm here to tell you it's a lie\n\nThere's strange things going on\nAt night most everywhere\nYou know those places well\nAnd you've never seen me there\nI walk by other men\nAnd I don't notice them\nBut then those rumors start again\n\nSo I'm gonna tell the world\nI don't wanna be a homosexual\nI'm gonna find a girl\n'Cause I don't wanna be a homosexual\nI guess that it's okay\nIf other guys are gay\nBut my hormones are one-directional\nAnd I don't wanna be a homosexual\n\nSomebody tell me what I did to start this talk\nIs it the way I look, is it the way I walk?\nIs it the clothes I wear\nThat make the people stare?\nIs it the way I comb my hair?\n\nI'm only hoping maybe there will come a day\nWhen I can make them understand that I'm not gay\nBut till that day is here\nI guess I'll live in fear\nAnd I curse the day I pierced my ear\n\nThere's nothing wrong with me\nI don't wanna be a homosexual\nKnow what I want to be\nAnd I don't wanna be a homosexual\nSoft boys and closet queens\nThink Judy Garland's keen\nBut I don't think she's nothing special\nAnd I don't wanna be a homosexual\n\n\nSo now I'm wondering if maybe they're not right\nI've gone all paranoid and I can't sleep at night\nI went to see the shrink\nWhat did the doctor think?\nI swear to God I saw him wink\n\nI pray that I am wrong\nI don't wanna be a homosexual\nWhy did I write this song\nIf I don't wanna be a homosexual?\nI hope it's not too late\nFor them to set me straight\nI'm gonna see a real professional\n'Cause I don't wanna be a homosexual\n\nNo\nNo, no, no, no\nNo, no, no, no, no\nNo, no, no, no, no, no\n\nI don't wanna be\nI don't wanna be\nI don't wanna be a homosexual\n\nI don't wanna go with guys named Seamus\nI don't wanna be rich and famous\nI don't wanna go to a French art festival\nI don't wannt be a homosexual\n\nI guess that it's okay\nIf other guys are gay",
