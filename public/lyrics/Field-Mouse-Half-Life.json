{"songs":"Half-Life by Field Mouse","lyrics":"Waking up in daylight\nI had never felt sad\nThe shit I traded in for calm\nStill out of sight\nAnd in the early morning someone brings you\nTo the train\nThe last face to say goodbye is\nSome odd stranger in the rain\nYou are terrified but never complain\n\nI have lived more lives than you\n\nWaking up in moonlight\nI had never felt that\nThe thoughts I traded in for calm\nStill out of mind\nAnd in the early morning someone brings you\nTo the train\nYou are terrified but you don't complain\n\nI have lived more lives than you\n\nHeard your secrets but I never made a sound\nYou ask for all of me but still you sleep on the ground\nYou've lost more since we last spoke than I ever have found","url":"https://genius.com/Field-mouse-half-life-lyrics"}
