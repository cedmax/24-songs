{"title":"I Never Promised You a Rose Garden by The Suicide Machines","lyrics":"I beg your pardon\nI never promised you a rose garden\nAlong with the sunshine\nThere's gotta be a little rain sometime\n\nWhen you take you gotta give\nSo live and let live\nAnd let go oh oh oh oh\nI beg your pardon\nI never promised you a rose garden\n\nI could promise you things like big diamond rings\nBut you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover\nSo you better think it over\n\nWell, if sweet talking you could make it come true\nI would give you the world right now on a silver platter\n\nBut what would it matter\n\nSo smile for a while and let's be jolly\nLove shouldn't be so melancholy\nCome along and share the good times while we can\n\nI beg your pardon\nI never promised you a rose garden\nAlong with the sunshine\nThere's gotta be a little rain sometime\n\nI beg your pardon\nI never promised you a rose garden\n\nI could sing you a tune\nAnd promise you the moon\nBut if that's what it takes to hold you\nI'd just as soon let you go\nBut there's one thing I want you to know\n\nYou'd better look before you leap\nStill waters run deep\nAnd there won't always be someone there to pull you out\n\nAnd you know what I'm talking about\n\nSo smile for a while and let's be jolly\nLove shouldn't be so melancholy\nCome along and share the good times while we can\n\nI beg your pardon\nI never promised you a rose garden\nAlong with the sunshine\nThere's gotta be a little rain sometime.....","url":"https://genius.com/The-suicide-machines-i-never-promised-you-a-rose-garden-lyrics"}
