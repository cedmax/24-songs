{"title":"Bad Bohemian by British Sea Power","lyrics":"You said the world was losing all its lustre\nYou realised each day you're growing old\nAnd the future stretches out there between us\nAnd we decide if we want it to be cold\n\nBut don't be a bad bohemian\nDon't be a bad bohemian\nDon't be a bad bohemian\nDon't be a bad bohemian\n\nIt's sad now how the glass looks rather empty\nThe formulation of the elements makes you yearn\nWhat's done is done, and there'll be no redemption\nJust periodic tables to be learned\n\nBut don't be a bad bohemian\nDon't be a bad bohemian\nDon't be a bad bohemian\nDon't be a bad bohemian\n\nOh, don't let us die\nWhile we are still alive\nOh, don't let us die\nWhile we are still alive\nWhile we are still alive\n\nSearch every default payoff\nSearch out there looking chaos\nWe'll do it fast, we'll do it clean and true\n\nBecause you're bad, you're bad, you're bad\nYou know it, and you're bad, you're bad\nDon't be a bad bohemian\n\nOh, don't let us die\nWhile we are still alive\nOh, don't let us die\nWhile we are still alive\n\nDon't be a bad bohemian\nDon't be a bad bohemian\nDon't be a bad bohemian\nDon't be a bad bohemian\nDon't be a bad bohemian","url":"https://genius.com/British-sea-power-bad-bohemian-lyrics"}
