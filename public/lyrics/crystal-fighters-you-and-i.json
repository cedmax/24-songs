{"lyrics":"Happy, spinning, clapping, laughing, dancing\nIn the blackness of magic\nGet it, have it, bag it\nThrow yourself on the aeroplane, fly like magic\n\nNo sleep no chance, no need to get about it\nOne life, live free, big dreams, we're all about them\nYou're finding it, take it, take it in, its all here\nYou and me, no one else, nothing else but us right now\n\nAnd I ain't need nothing else, no one else but you and I\nAnd it ain't me, it ain't you, its only us, its us right now\nYou're finding it, take it, take it in, its all here\nYou and me, no one else, nothing else but us right now\n\nAnd I ain't need nothing else, no one else but you and I\nAnd it ain't me, it ain't you, its only us, its us right now\nYou and me, no one else, nothing else but us right here\nYou and I, nothing else but you and I\n\nYou and I\nYou and I\nYou and I\nYou and I\n\nTime is not a constant my friend; You can't tell me how to die one again\nYa we gave ourselves the bends; To a line i'll never understand\nSpeed it up or if you mean it slow it up a little bit just to speed it back again\nHand me up or sit me down or I won't ham it up or simmer down with their brethren\n\nAnd I ain't need nothing else, no one else but you and I\nAnd it ain't me, it ain't you, its only us, its us right now\nYou're finding it, take it, take it in, its all here\nYou and me, no one else, nothing else but us right now\n\nAnd I ain't need nothing else, no one else but you and I\nAnd it ain't me, it ain't you, its only us, its us right now\nYou and me, no one else, nothing else but us right here\nYou and I, no one else but you and I\n\nYou and I\nYou and I\nYou and I\nYou and I\n\nYou and I, you and I\nOh-oh-oh, hard to find the words to tell\nOh-oh-oh, the story of you and I girl\nOh-oh-yeah, even though there's nothing left just\nYou and I, no one else, nothing else but you and I\n\nYou and I, you and I (ain't nobody else)\nYou and I, you and I\nYou and I no one, else nothing else but you and I\nYou and I, you and I (to me ain't nothing else)\nYou and I (yeah ain't nobody else)\nYou and I\nYou and I no one, else nothing else but you and I\nYou and I","url":"https://genius.com/Crystal-fighters-you-and-i-lyrics"}
