{"title":"I'm Confused by Handsome Furs","lyrics":"I saw their lights on the boulevard\nMy blood ran like water back and forth\nSomebody's out there\nThere's nothing to do\nMy mind was set on you\n\nI felt a chill creeping down my neck\nBut darling, please, say we're not done yet\nSomebody's out there\nThere's nothing to do\nMy mind was set on you\n\nI'm confused (3x)\nI know, my love, I know it's easy to do\n\nI hope this life don't get you down\nThis dirty old time in this dirty old town\nAnd if you're feeling instructive\nThere's something to do\nSometimes we get confused\n\nI'm confused (3x)\nI know, my love, I know it's easy to do\n\nI'm confused (3x)\nI know, my love, I know it's easy to do\nI'm confused (3x)","url":"https://genius.com/Handsome-furs-im-confused-lyrics"}
