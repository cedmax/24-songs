    "lyrics": "One day, an angel told me,  \"Your time here is fleeting\"\nBehind his back - a pistol - here comes a beating\nHis suit, his silk, flower, but my razor is faster\n\"Hey Carlos Gardel, you been drinkin' Florida water\"\n\nLooking for a new technique\nThey never believe I put my weapons down\nAnother page turns in the book\nAnother one falls on their knees to the ground\n\nA message from the tiger\nWhile she shivered\nLike chord on a harp without failure:\n\"the bedroom must be returned to its original sailor\"\nShe reached for the lipstick in her handbag\nBy the edge of the sink\nWhile her sad love surrounded the lady of perpetual squalor\n\nLooking for a new technique\nThey never believe I throw my weapons down\nAnother page turned in the book\nAnother one falls on their knees to the ground\nLooking for a new technique\nWe never believe I throw my weapons down\nAnother page turned in the book\nAnother one falls on their knees to the ground",
