{"title":"I Am the Walrus by The Beatles","lyrics":"I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together\nSee how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly\nI'm crying\n\nSitting on a cornflake\nWaiting for the van to come\nCorporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday\nMan, you've been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long\n\nI am the eggman, I am the eggman\nI am the walrus, goo goo a'joob\n\nMister City p'liceman sitting, pretty little p'licemen in a row\nSee how they fly like Lucy in the sky, see how they run\nI'm crying, I'm crying\nI'm crying, I'm crying\n\nYellow-matter custard\nDripping from a dead dog's eye\nCrab a locker fishwife, pornographic priestess\nBoy, you've been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down\n\nI am the eggman, they are the egg men\nI am the walrus, goo goo a'joob\n\nSitting in an English garden waiting for the sun\nIf the sun don't come, you get a tan from standing in the English rain\n\nI am the egg man (Now good sir, what are you?)\nThey are the egg men (A poor man, made tame to fortune's blows)\nI am the walrus, goo goo goo joob (Good pity)\nG'goo goo g'joob\n\nExpert, textpert, choking smokers\nDon't you think the joker laughs at you?\n(Ho ho ho, hee hee hee, ha ha ha)\nSee how they smile like pigs in a sty, see how they snied\nI'm crying\n\nSemolina pilchard\nClimbing up the Eiffel Tower\nElementary penguin singing Hare Krishna\nMan, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe\n\nI am the eggman, they are the eggmen\nI am the walrus, goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob\nGoo goo a'joob g'goo goo g'joob, g'goo\nJoob!
