    "lyrics": "I want to live where soul meets body\nAnd let the sun wrap its arms around me\nAnd bathe my skin in water, cool and cleansing and feel\nFeel what it's like to be new\n'Cause in my head there's a Greyhound station\nWhere I send my thoughts to far off destinations\nSo they may have a chance of finding a place\nWhere they're far more suited than here\n\nWell, I cannot guess what we'll discover\nWhen we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels\nBut I know our filthy hands can wash one another's\nAnd not one speck will remain\n\nI do believe it's true\nThat there are roads left in both of our shoes\nBut if the silence takes you, then I hope it takes me too\nSo, brown eyes, I'll hold you near\n'Cause you're the only song I want to hear\nA melody softly soaring through my atmosphere\n\nWhere soul meets body\nWhere soul meets body\nWhere soul meets body\n\nAnd I do believe it's true\nThat there are roads left in both of our shoes\nBut if the silence takes you, then I hope it takes me too\nSo, brown eyes, I'll hold you near\n'Cause you're the only song I want to hear\nA melody softly soaring through my atmosphere\n\nA melody softly soaring through my atmosphere\nA melody softly soaring through my atmosphere\nA melody softly soaring through my atmosphere",
