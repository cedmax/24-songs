{"songs":"Cubism Dream by Local Natives","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nShe flew across the sea\nWe talked on a small screen\nA cubism dream\nThe most beautiful squares I'd ever seen\nThe canvas was free\nA gift good mother gave to me\nWe joked at how they talked so differently\n\n[Chorus]\nI will never know what had rot my heart\nIt just came and went in the dark\nI had changed into the certain kind of man\nThat could break your heart with his own hands\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe were to scan our own towns\nAnd make good on what we found\nOh, what a fool I was to think\nThat I could get by on a smile and a wink\nI make a friend, I make you sick\nCould you even imagine a kiss?\nWe spoke of how we talked so differently\nI spoke of how I felt so differently\n\n[Chorus]\nI will never know what had rot my heart\nIt just came and went in the dark\nI had changed into the certain kind of man\nThat could break your heart with his own hands\n\n[Outro]\nSo in Australia, on Halloween\nI proved what our love meant to me\nThe suffering, the struggling\nI did it for you\nI did it for me\nI did it for me\nI did it for me\nI did it for me","url":"https://genius.com/Local-natives-cubism-dream-lyrics"}
