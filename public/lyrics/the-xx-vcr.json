{"title":"VCR by The xx","lyrics":"You, you used to have all the answers\nAnd you, you still have them too\nAnd we, we live half in the day time\nAnd we, we live half at night\n\nWatch things on VCRs, with me and talk about big love\nI think we're superstars, you say you think we are the best thing\nBut you, you just know, you just do\n\nWanna find myself by the sea, in another's company by the sea\nI wanna go out to the pier, I'm gonna dive and have no fear\nCos you, you just know, you just do\n\nWatch things on VCRs, with me and talk about big love\nI think we're superstars, you say you think we are the best thing\nBut you, you just know, you just do","url":"https://genius.com/The-xx-vcr-lyrics"}
