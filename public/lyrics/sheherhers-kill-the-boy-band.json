{"title":"Kill The Boy Band byÂ She/Her/Hers","lyrics":"You wanna go to a show tonight?\nYou can bring your girlfriend\nShe can hold your sweater when you go to the pit\n'Cause you know this is never\nFor her, no this is all about you, bro\n'Cause there's five bands playing tonight and they're dudes, you know\nIs this song about a girl or car, I can't tell the difference anymore\nNow wait I'm confused, is this not the same band that played before?\n\nAnd I wanna kill the boy band\nI wanna kill the boy band\nKill the boy band\n\nSo you started a band?\nWell, let me guess who's in it\nAll-straight, all-white, able-bodied cis men\n\nSay you don't know many female musicians\nWhy the fuck would they want to be part of a scene with people like you in it?\nIf you're going to start another all male punk band you might as well play country\nI'm so sick of men dominating every show in every fuckin' city\n\nAnd I wanna kill the boy band\nI wanna kill the boy band\nKill the boy band\nI wanna kill the boy band\nI wanna kill the boy band\nKill the boy band\nAnd I wanna kill the boy band\nI wanna kill the boy band\nKill the boy band\nI wanna kill the boy band\nI wanna kill the boy band\nKill the boy band","url":"https://genius.com/She-her-hers-kill-the-boy-band-lyrics"}
