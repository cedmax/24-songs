{"title":"Love Or Death by Hospital Ships","lyrics":"Open up the door and let me in\nI knew the well was dry when I returned to it again\nAnd what I need I'll never have\n'Cause it don't exist\nOpen up the door, time's gettin' thin\nThe earth will soldier on in its never-ceasing spin\nAnd soldier on with it, we will\n'Til we're good and dead\nDon't you know you are my dearest friend?\nYou're hearing what I say but you are seeing only him\nWho, like a mirror, just reflects\nHis lonely twin\nYou know his heart's as empty as his head\nHe's gesturing with broken arms, his feet are made of lead\nAnd this is where the world ends\nAnd I begin\nYou are on the outside\nAlways looking in\nBut I am on the inside\nSo goodbye, goodbye, goodbye!\nNow my song is gettin' near its end\nThe metaphors are all used up, our seams are trailing threads\nBut if it isn't love or death\nThen what is it?","url":"https://genius.com/Hospital-ships-love-or-death-lyrics"}
