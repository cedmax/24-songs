    "lyrics": "When I was just a little kid they told me to dream big\nYou can do anything\nWhen I got older they told me to stop dreaming\nStart being more realistic, make the coffee do the dishes\nBut I can't seem to keep my head out of the clouds\nCause what's the point of living life\nTo work until I die\nThat can't be it and if it is then I want out\nAnd honestly I never had a dream of getting older\nBut here I am what can I do about it, tell me what to do about it now\n\nCause I never wanted to be every single stereotype of a white middle class 20-something pissed at the economy\nI never meant to be the epitome of a quarter life crisis and being a junkie didn't live up to the hype\n\nWhen I was just a little kid they told me I was special\nThen I grew up and found out they told that to every single one of us\nGet addicted to our drugs then go away to universities\nWhere we'll sell you dreams then make you work for free\nThey handed us an economy that's destined us for poverty\nThen have the nerve to call us soft and lazy for complaining\nCause they're from a generation where you could be what you wanted to be\nBut baby I'm a 90's kid, only 90's kids will understand this\n\nGot bill collectors calling us to pay back student loans\nBut they can't ever find us if we throw away our phones\nThen we can sit in diners, drinking coffee smoking cigarettes outside\nLook in each others' eyes without cell phone lights to hide behind and\nWe can just kick off our shoes and make these sidewalks home\nWe'll write songs and sing for food and we'll never be alone\nNever be alone, never be alone, never be alone when we're with friends\nAnd we'll never owe shit to anyone else\nNo we'll never owe shit to anyone else\nNo we'll never owe shit to anyone else\nNo we'll never owe shit to anyone",
