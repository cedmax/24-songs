{"title":"No One Said It Would Be Easy by Cloud Cult","lyrics":"You came up from the ground\nFrom a million little pieces\nYou're a pretty human being\nYeah, you're a pretty human being\n\nWhen it all comes crashing down\nTry to understand your meaning\nNo one said it would be easy\nCause living, it ain't easy\n\nAnd you were sewn together with a tapestry of molecules\nA billion baby galaxies in wide open spaces\nAnd everything you need is here\nEverything you fear is here\nAnd it's holding you up\nIt just keeps holding you up\n\nYou came up from the ground\nFrom a million little pieces\nYou're a pretty human being\nYeah, you're a pretty human being\n\nWhen it all comes crashing down\nYou try to understand your meaning\nNo one said it would be easy\nThis living, it ain't easy","url":"https://genius.com/Cloud-cult-no-one-said-it-would-be-easy-lyrics"}
