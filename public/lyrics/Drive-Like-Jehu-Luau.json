    "lyrics": "Failures in outer space, failures and crimes\nLet's get something straight: it's not for mine, mine, mine, mine\nBefore you were born, after you die\nFailures in outer space, failures and crimes\n\nIt's in the water, it's in the earth\nIt's in the unit to measure the curse\nLength depth, whatever it's worth\nIt's in the unit to measure the curse\n\nIt's in the setup yeah it's built in\nWhatever the get up, yeah it's built in\n\nWait for the rub-out, wait for the purge\nWipe the last haole the fuck off our turf!\nForget what you thought! Forget what you heard!\nWipe the last haole the fuck off our turf!\n\nAloha, aloha! Suit up!\nLuau, luau! Luau, luau!\nAloha, aloha! Suit up!\nLuau, luau! Luau, luau!\nSuit up!\n\nWait til the rub-out, wait for the purge\nForget what you thought! Forget what you heard!\nWipe the last haole the fuck off our turf!\nForget what you thought! Forget what you heard!\nIt's in the setup yeah it's built in\nWhatever the get up, yeah it's built in\n\nKill all the tourists and we'll all sleep sound\nCash-in their fillings & blow it in town, yeah\nWe'll blow it on rifles, we'll blow it on drinks\nHead in the corner, head in the sink\n\nAloha, aloha! Suit up!\nLuau, luau! Luau, luau!\nAloha, aloha! Suit up!\nLuau, luau! Luau, luau!\nSuit up!",
