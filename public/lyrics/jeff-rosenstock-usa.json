{"title":"USA by Jeff Rosenstock (Ft. Chris Farren & Laura Stevenson)","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nDumbfounded, downtrodden, and dejected\nCrestfallen, grief-stricken, and exhausted\nTrapped in my room while the house was burning to the motherfuckin' ground\nI saw the sign but it was misleading\nI fought the law, but the law was cheating\nScreaming for help, but somebody keeps on telling me to settle down\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd please be honest\nAnd tell me, was it you?\n\n[Verse 2]\nClerk at the Midwestern service station\nStriped uniform, giggling at catch phrases\nLook in her eyes like we’re up to something\nOh, it doesn't matter now\nMan in a crossover with his family\nSketched-in decals on the window smiling\nDrivin' parallel in the lane beside me\nOh, it doesn't matter now\n\n[Chorus]\nBut please be honest\nAnd tell me, was it you?\nI won't hate you\nI just need to know\nPlease be honest\nAnd tell me, was it you?\n\n[Bridge]\nAt first he thought it was the undertow\nBut he was dragged to the bottom of the lake\nBy a couple of kids saying, \"It's a joke\"\nThough he didn't know any of their names\nAs they held him down, the crowd got loud\nAnd they cheered when they thought he had escaped\nWhen the anchor needed something for the 10 o'clock\nWhat could they say?\nOh, what else could they say?\n\nThey said\n\"Well, you promised us the stars\nWell, you promised us the stars\nWell, you promised us the stars\nWell, you promised us the stars\nAnd now we’re tired and bored\" (x62)\n\n(et tu, USA\nEt tu, et tu, USA)","url":"https://genius.com/Jeff-rosenstock-usa-lyrics"}
