{"title":"A Pirate's Anthem by Oh No Oh My","lyrics":"This is the end\nOh this is the end\nTake our dear friends\nThis is the end\nWe were the perfect part\nWe were the perfect part\nLet's go and celebrate sometime\nMaybe next week I'll stay till 9\nI can't pretend\nWe're only 10\nAnd I am in love\nWe were the perfect part\nWe'll make the perfect part\nLet's go and celebrate sometime\nMaybe next week I'll stay till 9\nAnd I'll take my arrow and I'll shoot the dead\nTo make sure that they're in their place and I'm at the head\nWe have good times\nWe're no strangers, we drink all the time!\nAnd I'll have my angel be your angel too\nBecause I'm uneasy and I'm just like you\nWe have good times\nWe're no strangers, we drink all the time!\nWe have good times\nWe have bottles and bottles of wine!\nAnd I'll throw the fiery swords at the brig\nSometimes it's better to be darker in June\nWe have good times\nWe're no strangers, we drink all the time!\nWe have good times\nWe have bottles and bottles of wine!\nWe have good times\nWe are tubby and drink all we like!\nWhat I could do\nWhat I could do\nWhat I can do\nWhat I could do","url":"https://genius.com/Oh-no-oh-my-a-pirates-anthem-lyrics"}
