{"title":"Kill Me Again by The WAEVE","lyrics":"Go to the silver moon\nFind the power there to see you through\nDark afternoon\nEcstatic, magic night\n\nTake me to your brightest sun\nHold me fast beneath your hand\nI hang like a bird\nAbove your sea and land\n\nLove burns\nNever denied\nCome inside\nTurn this tide\n\nIt's not in the words you're singing\nIt's not in the things you do\nWe fight for our lives\nBeneath the sun and moon\n\nI went to the silver moon\nAsked for power there to see me through\nDark afternoon\nEcstatic, magic night\n\nTake me to your brightest sun\nHold me fast 'till the day is done\nYou hang like a bird\nAbove my sea and land\n\nIt's not in the words you're singing\nIt's not in the things you do\nWe fight for our lives\nBeneath the sun and moon\n\nLove burns\nNever denied\nPull me down\nTurn this tide\n\nI run through your fingers laughing\nI fall through your eyes and then\nI don't care if I'm dying\nKill me again\n\nI run through your fingers laughing\nI fall through your eyes and then\nI don't care if I'm dying\nKill me again\n\nKill me again\nKill me again","url":"https://genius.com/The-waeve-kill-me-again-lyrics"}
