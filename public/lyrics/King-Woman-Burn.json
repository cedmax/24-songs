{"title":"Burn by King Woman","lyrics":"If your light is dark\nHow deep that darkness is\nYou’re living like a loose bolt\nSpinning at the head\n\nNow that you’re glorious death\nNow that you’re faithless flesh\nNow that you’re spiritless void\nYou’re hanging on by a thread\n\nI’m living\nSo separate\nFull of hell\nJudge just waiting\nI’m dying\nRestless youth\nFull of hell\n\nLike I’ve always been\nBurn after you read\nLove I cannot keep\nOnly in my sleep\nOnly when i dream","url":"https://genius.com/King-woman-burn-lyrics"}
