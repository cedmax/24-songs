{"title":"25! by Bomb the Music Industry!","lyrics":"I walked two miles in the rain in a suit, my feet torn up by my father's shoes\nReceipts and cards tumble out of my pocket to the floor of the station, I still don't have a wallet\nUp a flight of stairs to Herald Square, the umbrellas of New York take up too much air\nSo we just walk real slow at double-arms-length, in unison\n\nMy mom dragged me to the doctor today, I've had a cough for a month and it won't go away\nI've been sleeping on floors for three hours a day and I've got no insurance so she has to pay\nI can't talk to my friends because I'm embarrassed\nThat I keep sliding back down, I keep getting depressed\n\nWe got our ideals but no way to achieve them\nWe got our degree but got no means to use it\nWe’re swimming in debt with no way to surmount it\nWe got thirty bucks and we spend it on whiskey\nWe got credit cards, so we got a new TV\nWe got mobile phones but no minutes, so text me\n\nGet out of my way because I'm 25\nAnd I still act like I'm 10\nI'm 25 and I don't learn from my mistakes\nSo I make them again and again and again and again and again\n\nWe swallow our pride over piles of problems\nWe whine and complain but we don't try to solve them\nWe're reaching for answers but nobody's got them\n\nGet out of my way because I'm 25\nAnd I still act like I'm 10 goddamn years old\nI'm 25\nAnd I still act like I'm 10 goddamn years old","url":"https://genius.com/Bomb-the-music-industry-25-lyrics"}
