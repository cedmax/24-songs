{"title":"Lazarus Phenomenon by Bike For Three!","lyrics":"(Here, it's perfectly dark)\n(Here, it's perfectly dark)\n(Dark)\n(Dark)\n\nThe boy was an old cat and the girl was a clever mouse\nDidn't matter where they went, in whichever house\nMotel, suitcases and rental cars\nPhotos and empty bottles, memories and mental scars\nRaising heck, surveying damages, appraising wrecks\nLong nights and fights that ended with amazing sex\nMoments that were equally quiet and uproarious\nFrequently slow dancing in the kitchen, it was glorious\nUnknowns, they broke each other's bones and built camp fires\nThey jumped out of windows and lived like vampires\nThey'd bathe in the same water, same anguish\nThey spoke bad French but laughed in the same language\n\nThe boy was an old cat and the girl was a clever mouse\nUnswimmable waters and flames they could never douse\nOne minute they were millionaires, the next they'd be the poorest\nWhat he liked about her was that she could see the forest\nSteering clear of some troubles, averting wrongs\nThey drew curtains and died together over certain songs\nOpposites, theirs was a friendship of the rare sort\nThey'd steal books and talk dirty at the airport\nEvangelists amongst themselves, it was scandalous\nCompany was kept by Joan of Los Angeles\nDiamonds and crying eyes, short tempers and fast drives\nPromises and unsolved mysteries and past lives\n\nAnd I can't help but wonder\nWill you recognize my face\nI hope so\n(I hope so)\nHere, it's perfectly dark\nAnd I can't help but wonder\nWill you recognize my face\nI hope so\n(I hope so)\nHere, it's perfectly dark\nHere, it’s perfectly dark\nHere, it’s perfectly dark\nHere, it’s perfectly\nHere, it’s\nHere, perfectly dark\n\nThe girl was a clever mouse, the boy was an old cat\nDiamonds are forever, but they were never told that\nHe'd lay there beside her, awake for safekeeping\nWhile she'd ask questions to the river while she was sleeping\nAnd who by accident, the emptiness had grown quick\nShe stood on his shoulders, but for heaven, he was homesick\nLong before the end came he already missed her\nShe went slowly out of focus and he died without a whisper\n\nAnd I can't help but wonder\nWill you recognize my face\nI hope so\n(I hope so)\nHere, it's perfectly dark\nAnd I can't help but wonder\nWill you recognize my face\nI hope so\n(I hope so)\n‘Cause here, it's perfectly dark\n(Dark)","url":"https://genius.com/Bike-for-three-lazarus-phenomenon-lyrics"}
