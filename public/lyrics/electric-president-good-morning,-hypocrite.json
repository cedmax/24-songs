{"title":"Good Morning, Hypocrite by Electric President","lyrics":"Feels like the roads stretch out like veins\nBut there's no heart\nNature's haircut is concrete now\nWe played our part\nSo we sing\n\nBa da, da da, ba da da da da da\nBa da, da da, ba da da da da da\nBa da, da da, ba da da da da da\nBa da, da da, ba da da da da da\n\nI've lost my taste for modern things\nThey're not for me\nI want mundane, a quiet place\nWhere time is free\nAnd I can sing\n\nBa da, da da, ba da da da da da\nBa da, da da, ba da da da da da\nBa da, da da, ba da da da da da\nBa da, da da, ba da da da da da\n\nCrawled from my bed\nTo collect the thoughts that'd fallen from my head\nAnd you watched me sink\nThrough the carpet, through the basement, and beyond\nAnd you didn't blink\n\nOn the glass I traced the sun with my thumb; it sank into the ground\nAnd then the stars were blinking like kids who were staring into the wind\nSo I climbed through the window and walked until I lost my name\nNow I can play the victim, it's fine, I've seen it on TV\nIf there's one thing I know, it's that I never really know enough\n\nOur heads, our mouths, our brains, our lungs, they're just machines\nThese hearts are all that we've got left and they don't beat\n\nLive a little, talk a lot, it's the way this goes\nI've come to fear the little knives beneath their well-pressed clothes\nTheir arms are reaching, reach is spreading through the neon glow\nTheir mouths are moving, but their voices sound like telephones\nThe traffic hums, the traffic grumbles near my old window\nThe street lights flicker, glow and hover like suspended snow\nI used to watch the moon retreat and wonder where it goes\nNow I just wonder why my head is overrun with ghosts","url":"https://genius.com/Electric-president-good-morning-hypocrite-lyrics"}
