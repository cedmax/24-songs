{"title":"Gates by The Menzingers","lyrics":"I am the pain that beats through your temples\nEvery morning when you wake up\nI am the boy with alcohol poisoning\nFrom all the parties Chris was throwing\nThat summer that they took us in\nLike every other American\nFor getting drunk round the back of the Lions' Club\nWaiting for the shitty bands to finish up\nAnd some kids played hacky sack while the others just got high\n\nIt's not hard to fall for a waitress\nWhen you both smoke, smoke the same cigarettes\nYou'll get seated as diner's lovers\nShe'll get the check as friends for the better\nYou'll carve your names into the Paupack cliffs\nJust to read them when you get old enough to know\nThat happiness is just a moment\n\nSo, I'm marching up to your gates today\nTo throw my lonely soul away\n'Cause I don't need it, you can take it back\nSo, I'm marching up to your gates today\nTo throw my lonely soul away\n'Cause I don't need it, you can take it back\n\nAnd they will make examples out of us\nLike when they caught you in the CVS parking lot\nBut I fed the liars, I fed the liars\nI fed the liars everything I got, everything I got\nIn my cabinet brain of canned thoughts\nIt was everything I got, oh everything I got\nIn my cabinet brain, in my cabinet brain\n\nSo, I'm marching up to your gates today\nTo throw my lonely soul away\n'Cause I don't need it, you can take it back\nSo, I'm marching up to your gates today\nTo throw my lonely soul away\n'Cause I don't need it, you can take it back\n\nSo, I'm marching up to your gates today\nTo throw my lonely soul away\nI don't need it, you can take it back","url":"https://genius.com/The-menzingers-gates-lyrics"}
