{"songs":"The Step and the Walk by The Duke Spirit","lyrics":"Ten english pounds and these hot pavement fields\nAs though I'm moving to the end\nAm I moving to the end of your loving?\n\nHow, how did I do this?\nMe, I put the wall around my heart\nWhy didn't I notice such cold detachment from the start?\nOh, the jaws they slammed down\nAnd the one in this town burns bright enough\n\nWithout joy, joy, joy in the rain\nI could feel forever the same\nWithout joy, joy, joy in the rain\nI could feel forever the same\n\nSo how, how did I do this?\nOh, me I put that box around my heart\nWhy couldn't I notice such a cool detachment from the start?\nOh, the joys they slammed down\nFrom the one in this town burns bright enough\n\nWithout joy, joy, joy in the rain\nI could feel forever the same\nWithout joy, joy, joy in the rain\nYeah I could feel forever the same\n\nWithout joy, joy, joy in the rain\nI could feel forever the same\nWithout joy, joy, joy in the rain\nYeah I could feel forever the same\nWithout joy, joy, joy in the rain\nOh I could feel forever the same\nWithout joy, joy, joy in the rain\nI could feel forever the same","url":"https://genius.com/The-duke-spirit-the-step-and-the-walk-lyrics"}
