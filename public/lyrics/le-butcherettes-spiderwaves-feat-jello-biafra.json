    "lyrics": "[Chorus: Teri Gender Bender]\nInjuries are slashed deep open\nMessiahs hold them still\nInjuries are slashed deep open\nMessiahs hold them still\n\n[Verse 1: Teri Gender Bender]\nHeatwaves calling for a thunder strike\nYou’ve tied us up, slowly lost the light\nLosing five pesos on a day of work hard\nFor once, come closer, listen to my cry\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Teri Gender Bender]\nYou’re a liar\nYou can’t erase my fight from prophecies\nNo apologies are wanted\nRazors cut your grace\n\n[Chorus: Teri Gender Bender]\nInjuries are slashed deep open\nMessiahs hold them still\nInjuries are slashed deep open\nMessiahs hold them still\nIn, you want in, in, you want in\n\n[Verse 2: Teri Gender Bender]\nSlave gold mercy isn’t here to stay\nPatience leaves me when I see your way\nConfusion arises as I try to latch on\nI was Mother Mary, smothered by her God\n[Pre-Chorus: Teri Gender Bender]\nYou’re a liar\nYou can’t erase my fight from prophecies\nNo apologies are wanted\nRazors cut your grace\n\n[Chorus: Teri Gender Bender]\nInjuries are slashed deep open\nMessiahs hold them still\nInjuries are slashed deep open\nMessiahs hold them still\nIn, you want in, in, you want in, in, you want in\n\n[Bridge: Teri Gender Bender]\nLies, they’re all lies!\nYour feathers are falling while you fly\nWhy can’t I feel anything when you say goodbye?\n\n[Chorus: Teri Gender Bender]\nInjuries are slashed deep open\nMessiahs hold them still\nInjuries are slashed deep open\nMessiahs hold them still\nInjuries are slashed deep open\nMessiahs hold them still\nInjuries are slashed deep open\nMessiahs hold them still\nIn, you want in, in, you want in, in, you want in\nIn, you want in, in, you want in, in, you want in\nInjuries are slashed deep open\nMessiahs hold them still\n[Outro: Jello Biafra]\nNot in service, not in service\nIs that all anyone aspires to these days, is \"Not in service\"?\nThey can't even count their dead, much less remember them\nMaybe what they need is to abolish the study of law\n\nYou know how it is around here\nYou want anything to say to me, put it in writing\nThey'll sue you for believing in something these days\nThey wear the individual on their face like a mask, but their hearts are embroidered with industry\n\nMan \"thinks\" but he only succeeds in enslaving himself\nBut, I've invented a device for the simultaneous pacification of various tapeworms\nAnd for every professional net of pre-disposed insult: a shot of true nobility!",
