{"title":"Flash by Joan As Police Woman","lyrics":"Oh my lover, won't you tell me now\nAll the things that you fear\n‘Cause I am a lover for the first time\nI am ready to hear\nI am ready to hear\n\nShow me lover all the things you see\nAll the apples you find\nShow me the colours of the things that move you\nIn and out of your mind\nIn and out of your mind\n\nI heard a flash\nI heard a flash\nI heard a flash\nI heard a flash\n\nSing to me lover all the things you hear\nAll your moments in time\nLet me in the rhythms of your heart\nAnd how your eyes rhyme\nAnd how your eyes rhyme\n\nPart me lover like the red sea\nPlease don't hold back\nHelp me remember that I can't forget\nAnd paint me jet black\nPaint me jet black\n\nI heard a flash\nI heard a flash\nI heard a flash\n\nDon't you wonder when the earth will go\nWatch the oceans wash away the snow\n\nOh my lover let me tell you now\nAll the things that I feel\nI already cried a river so deep\nNow I'm ready to heal\nNow I'm ready to kneel\n\nI heard a flash\nI heard a flash\nI heard a flash\nI heard a flash\nI heard a flash\nI heard a flash","url":"https://genius.com/Joan-as-police-woman-flash-lyrics"}
