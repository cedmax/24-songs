    "lyrics": "When the SS crashed the party\nMy favorite band was setting up onstage\nNow they're wearing their hair like you and your sister\nStacking up records, setting them straight\n\nHow it used to be\nOh yeah it really used to\nYou'll get used to it\nAnd forget all the ways and the names of the new police\n\nRescue she came from south of Manitoba\nRiding on the back of a jelly roll\nSold your soul to Saxophone Joel\nJazz Comment cries:\n\nHe looks just like James Dean!\nOh, that is James Dean!\nYou'll get used to it\nAnd forget all the ways and the names of the new high priest\nYeah\n\nCome down, Daniel, to the lion's den\nThere are opportunities in foreign communities\nWho wears a collar? Who wears a crown?\nWhere is the college in the campus town?\nI used to know\nOh yeah, I swear I used to\nYou'll get used to it\nAnd forget all the ways and the names of the new Ho King\n\nA million people's faces\nIs a hard act to follow\nA million wacky races\nRunning through the hall, oh yeah\nA million private spaces\nFilling up tomorrow\nA million people's faces\nIs a hard act to follow\n\nWhen I was 18\nSomeone got stabbed in a church\nBut I got used to it\nAnd forgave all the ways and the names\nIt was so long ago, anyways\n\nCome down, Daniel, to the lion's den\nCome down, Daniel, to the lion's den\nCome down, Daniel, to the lion's den\nCome down, Daniel, to the lion's den\nCome down, Daniel (Come down, Daniel)\nCome down, Daniel (Come down, Daniel)\nOh come down, Daniel\nCome on down, Daniel\nYou come down, Daniel\nIt's a hard kind of lover who won't even look in your eyes\nAnd it's a hard kind of life when you can't even open your eyes\n\nA million people's faces",
