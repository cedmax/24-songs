{"title":"The Newport 500 by Vic Spencer (Ft. Monster Mike)","lyrics":"They say the grass is greener on the other side of wonderland\nI’m not so sure about that; look at all who’s got the upper hand\nI think I’ve got a better change with the queen of hearts\nOff with my head, at least I won’t see the whole damn world fall apart\n\nI’m dizzy and confused\nThey say I’m just young & amused\nBut I won’t fall for that anymore\nThe jester’s all out of tricks\nDistracts with shiny diamond kicks\nDancin’ round’n’round the town\nAs it all burns on down\n\nLoad up on posy in our pockets\nThe new plague’s comin’ faster than crotch rockets\nLet’s all shove bullets down our guns & in our throats\nAnd we’ll all explode in 3…2…GO!\n\nCome on, let’s drift on down\nTo hell and back","url":"https://thenewports.bandcamp.com/track/off-with-my-head"}
