    "lyrics": "Can you treat it like an oil well\nWhen it's underground, out of sight?\nAnd if the site is just a whore-sign\nCan it make enough sense to me?\n\nPretend the table is a trust-knot\nWe'll put our labels down, faith is down\nI'll watch a yarn of twine unravel\nAnd you'll never get it back\n\nIt's what I want (It's what I want)\nIt's what I want (Twine comes down)\nIt's what I want (It's what I want)\nDon't you know? I could make it dry, make it dry, make it dry\n\nI've been crowned the king of it\nAnd it is all we have, so wait\nTo hear my words and they're diamond-sharp\nI could open it up and it's up and down\n\nIt's what I want (It's what I want)\nI'll see you beg like a little dog (Ball and twine)\nDon't you know that it's what I want (It's what I want)\nI'll see you beg, and it makes you dry\nMake me dry, make me dry, make me dry\n\nI've been down, the king of it\nIt's all we have, I've been down\nAnd I could wait\nTo hear the words\nThey're diamond-sharp today",
