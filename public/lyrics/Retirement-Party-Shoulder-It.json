{"songs":"Shoulder It by Retirement Party","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nI can’t say I was strong before I met you\nI can’t say that I stood very tall\nI’m not sure if you exactly gave me the courage\nBut you picked me up when I didn’t know I was about to fall\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou drove out all my tendencies and contents\nSaid goodbye to my shell for once and for all\nYou drove me to abandon the temporary but I didn’t know that you wouldn’t always be here to watch me finish it off\nAnd let me tell you that I am thankful for it every day\nIt may be over now, but to hell 'cause it's not too late\nYou had your place here but now I’m stuck carrying all the weight\nBut it's alright, 'cause you taught me to shoulder it","url":"https://genius.com/Retirement-party-shoulder-it-lyrics"}
