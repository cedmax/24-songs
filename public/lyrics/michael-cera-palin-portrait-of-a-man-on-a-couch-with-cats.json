{"title":"Portrait of a Man on a Couch With Cats by Michael Cera Palin","lyrics":"Was raised to believe that hell's just for the people in my head\nSuch a dear friend to me to make me believe it's where I'm living\nSo so long fairweather friends, I'll see you when I'm feeling more eloquent\nGod willing then, I'll be easier to digest\n\nI hope you don't mind me\nIn the corner, losing sleep\nAs you step out the door to leave\n\nGoddamn, I need a cigarette\nAnything for me to excuse my weighted chest\nI have lots of growing left, so please call me on it\nBut in the end I think we could all be more honest\nSo I cannot hold my head too high\nIf I'm trying to acknowledge all these faults of mine\nIt's a process that never ceases to remind\nJust when I think I can leave my shadow behind\n\nIn other words, I'm doing well\nI'm learning what care means without anyone else\nI don't blame you, I wish I could've left myself\nBut my wrist is now clean and my thoughts are more clear\nI hope you will listen, but hope you won't hear me\nTripping, stumbling, falling on deaf ears\n\nThese issues aren't unique\nBut it's so hard to not feel bleak\nWhen I haven't slept all week\n\nBut I still keep hanging on\n\nI will bear this heavy chest, let it rise and fall\nAnd maybe I'll grow out of it before I'm done\nBut you won't catch me hedging me bets on it\nI just might be more effort than I'm worth\nI guess I can't blame you, but I can't say it doesn't hurt\nWon't say I'll make it up to you, but what I know for sure\nIs I'm thankful that you ever happened\n\nI'm still here. I'm still trying\nI still fear that I'm lying and it's really not fine","url":"https://genius.com/Michael-cera-palin-portrait-of-a-man-on-a-couch-with-cats-lyrics"}
