{"title":"Everything's Coming Undone by Michael Stipe","lyrics":"Museum pieces\nIn bits and pieces\nIf I can\nWrite my name in\n\nIn the dust on\nOn my dresser drawer\nTells you something's wrong\nAnd how everything's coming undone\n\nArchaeology\nDid you want to study me?\nYou know that I'll never be\nThe way that I used to be\n\nWalking lonely\nAnd leaving early\nIf I could I'd run\nBut now everything's coming undone\nEverything's coming undone\n\nThe chronology\nWhen you ran back to the back\nI think that I'm beginning to know\nThis version of you you're beginning to show\n\nThat I made up\nSo I could stay around\nAnd it's the web I spun\nBut now everything's coming undone\n\nEverything's coming undone\nEverything's coming undone\nEverything's coming undone\nEverything's coming undone\nEverything...everything\nEverything's coming undone","url":"https://genius.com/Michael-stipe-everythings-coming-undone-lyrics"}
