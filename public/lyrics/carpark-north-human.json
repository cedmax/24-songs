{"title":"Human by Carpark North","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nYou're so right and you don't think you're wrong\nYou're not on the list and you're not in my songs\nI did right to walk and just leave you there\n'Cause no one can stand your fear of fear (uh)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou're so wrong and you still think you're right\nAnd I was too old to pick that fight\nAnd nothing you touched is changed today\nI broke up with you 'cause you didn't change me\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, yes, it's human\nIt's just human, you noticed?\nYeah, you're just human\nDid you notice? Damn right\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou're so right and you don't think you're wrong\nYou're not on the list and you're not in my songs\nI did right to walk and just leave you there\n'Cause no one can stand your fear of fear\n\n[Bridge]\nYeah, yes, it's human\nIt's just human, you noticed?\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, yes, it's human\nIt's just human, you noticed?\nYeah, you're just human\nDid you notice?
