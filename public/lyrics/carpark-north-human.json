Damn right\n\nYou're so right and you don't think you're wrong\nYou're not on the list and you're not in my songs\nI did right to walk and just leave you there\n'Cause no one can stand your fear of fear\n\nYeah, yes, it's human\nIt's just human, you noticed?\n\nYeah, yes, it's human\nIt's just human, you noticed?\nYeah, you're just human\nDid you notice? Damn right",
