    "lyrics": "Gotta get up, gotta get out\nGotta get home before the morning comes\nWhat if I'm late, got a big day\nGotta get home before the sun comes up\nUp and away, got a big day, sorry can't stay\nI gotta run run, yeah\nGotta get home, pick up the phone\nGotta let the people know I'm gonna be late\n\nThere was a time when we could dance until a quarter to ten\nWe never thought it would end then\nWe never thought it would end\nWe used to carry on and drink and do the rock and roll\nWe never thought we'd get old, though\nWe never thought we'd grow cold, but now\n\nGotta get up, gotta get out\nGotta get home before the morning comes\nWhat if I'm late, got a big day\nGotta get home before the sun comes up\nUp and away, got a big day, sorry can't stay\nI gotta run run, yeah\nGotta get home, pick up the phone\nGotta let the people know I'm gonna be late\n\nDown by the sea she knew a sailor who had been to war\nShe never even knew a sailor before\nShe never even knew his name\nHe'd come to town and he would pound her for a couple of days\nAnd then he'd sail across the bubbly waves\nAnd those were happier days, but now\n\nGotta get up, gotta get out\nGotta get home before the morning comes\nWhat if I'm late, got a big day\nGotta get home before the sun comes up\nUp and away, got a big day, sorry can't stay\nI gotta run run, yeah\nGotta get home, pick up the phone\nGotta let the people know I'm gonna be late",
