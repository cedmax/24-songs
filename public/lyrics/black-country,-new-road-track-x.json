{"title":"Track X by Black Country, New Road","lyrics":"You've got great hips\nI've been shaking ever since\nYou told me \"No love would live in this house\"\nTurned out the inside inside out\nI tried my best to stay afloat\nAfter I sacrificed the goat\nIn your name, in the same room where we fucked as kids\nWith Abraham and Isaac and all of my greatest hits\n\nAnd I guess, in some way\n\nDancing to Jerskin, I got down on my knees\nI told you I loved you in front of black midi\nI told my friend Jack that it could've been you\nI know it was funny, but I was struggling too\nI left my drink on the eighteenth floor\nI thought about jumping and your face when you saw\nI thought of my father and proving him wrong\nBut mostly Mollie and Dylan and my mum\n\nAnd I guess, in some way","url":"https://genius.com/Black-country-new-road-track-x-lyrics"}
