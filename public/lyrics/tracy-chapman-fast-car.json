{"title":"Fast Car by Tracy Chapman","lyrics":"You got a fast car\nI want a ticket to anywhere\nMaybe we make a deal\nMaybe together, we can get somewhere\nAny place is better\nStarting from zero, got nothing to lose\nMaybe we'll make something\nMe, myself, I got nothing to prove\n\nYou got a fast car\nI got a plan to get us outta here\nI been working at the convenience store\nManaged to save just a little bit of money\nWon't have to drive too far\nJust 'cross the border and into the city\nYou and I can both get jobs\nFinally see what it means to be living\n\nSee, my old man's got a problem\nHe lives with a bottle, that's the way it is\nHe says his body's too old for working\nHis body's too young to look like his\nWhen mama went off and left him\nShe wanted more from life than he could give\nI said, \"Somebody's gotta take care of him\"\nSo I quit school, and that's what I did\n\nYou got a fast car\nIs it fast enough so we can fly away?\nWe gotta make a decision\nLeave tonight, or live and die this way\n\nSo I remember when we were driving\nDriving in your car\nSpeed so fast, it felt like I was drunk\nCity lights lay out before us\nAnd your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder\nAnd I-I had a feeling that I belonged\nI-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone\n\nYou got a fast car\nWe go cruising, entertain ourselves\nYou still ain't got a job\nAnd I work in a market as a checkout girl\nI know things will get better\nYou'll find work and I'll get promoted\nWe'll move out of the shelter\nBuy a bigger house and live in the suburbs\n\nSo I remember when we were driving\nDriving in your car\nSpeed so fast, it felt like I was drunk\nCity lights lay out before us\nAnd your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder\nAnd I-I had a feeling that I belonged\nI-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone\n\nYou got a fast car\nI got a job that pays all our bills\nYou stay out drinkin' late at the bar\nSee more of your friends than you do your kids\nI'd always hoped for better\nThought maybe together, you and me'd find it\nI got no plans, I ain't going nowhere\nSo take your fast car and keep on driving\n\nSo I remember when we were driving\nDriving in your car\nSpeed so fast, it felt like I was drunk\nCity lights lay out before us\nAnd your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder\nAnd I-I had a feeling that I belonged\nI-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone\n\nYou got a fast car\nIs it fast enough so you can fly away?\nYou gotta make a decision\nLeave tonight or live and die this way","url":"https://genius.com/Tracy-chapman-fast-car-lyrics"}
