{"title":"Our Bipolar Friends by Johnny Foreigner","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nIf you could see me now, blending in like ninja\nYou'd wonder why you bothered\nWell, someone somewhere is already bored of you\nAnd all I can ask, when I get back\nIf you could leave the light on if you're not staying up\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe says it's written in the stars\nBut I don't look at the stars anymore\nI just want someone to die for\nYou're as good, you're as good as anyone\nThe right lighting and a little less distant\nHow distance eroded you\nDid doubt fill up your shoes with problems you could dance to?\nYou should be wary what you listen to\nHow every song you love will turn into one note\nThat echoes on everything, one note\n\n[Verse 3]\nSweaty kids on pills aren't kids anymore\nYou're twenty-four and still chewing your insides out\nWe don't care what your scene's about\nSo many shows and no one turns out\nAll the girls in the front row stare at your hands\nAll the guys at the back bar talking shit about our band\nYou should be wary what you listen to\nHow every song you love will turn into one note\nThat echoes on everything, one note\n\n[Bridge]\nSome party scenes I wish to God I never walked in on\nSome unmarked cars I wish I never stepped out in front of\nYou let that guy in your house\nAnd now your house is on fire\nAnd now your house is on fire\n\n[Outro]\nTook all your strength to hold your tongue\nYou have to make your own mistakes to make you learn\nYou almost prayed for a sudden ending\nOne note","url":"https://genius.com/Johnny-foreigner-our-bipolar-friends-lyrics"}
