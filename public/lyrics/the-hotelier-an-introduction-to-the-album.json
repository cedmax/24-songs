{"title":"An Introduction to the Album by The Hotelier","lyrics":"Open the curtains\nSinging birds tell me\n\"Tear the buildings down.\"\nYou felt blessed\nTo receive their pleasant sound\nOf things that break\nMake you cringe\nInside yourself there's a child\nCounting stars in their time-out\nOf their day\nIn the corners of their frame\nThey are encased\nIn the losing of a grain\nOf themselves\nPushed against the ebb and flow\nWave good-bye and watch it go\n\nWell show me the honest, proper way\nTo disarm predatory gaze\nSucking dry\nNever satiated\nYou've been misused\nBeen rewired\nYou're short-circuiting now\nJust remember when\nYou'd call me to come\nTake a deep breath, and then jump\nSo fragile are bodies\nSo concave, work in\nSelf-destructive ways\n\nShot from the hip and missed\nDetaching from all of this\nIn physical pictures you remain\nSpiral 'round yourself in figure-eight\nI recoil at every new beginning\n\nI searched for a way out\nDon't we all?\nExistentialist recall:\nTurn in all dichotomies and\nTruths that I gave\nI felt wrong in many ways\nDidn't heal\nJust got harder every day\nTo be still\nTo be passing\nThrough the throes\nIn a daze\nFeeling heavy\nFeeling cold in my skin\nIn my hand-me-downs\nWearing everything thin\nAnd the pills\nThat you gave didn't do anything\nI just slept for years on end\n(Fuck!)\n\n[Guitar solo]\n\nSo if I call\nShould I beg?\nBecause I'm desperate here;\nA couple steps from the edge\nI can't seem to burn bright enough\nI'm cold and I'm left alone\nWe're all alone\nGrab a hold\nI know I said to not\nWhat the fuck do I know?\nI had a chance\nTo construct\nSomething beautiful\nAnd I choked","url":"https://genius.com/The-hotelier-an-introduction-to-the-album-lyrics"}
