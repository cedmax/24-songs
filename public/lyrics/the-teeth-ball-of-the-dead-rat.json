    "lyrics": "It's been too many nights\nThat you've been creeping around\nStumbling like a monkey\nThrough the underground\nOhh\nAnd you don't wanna be alone\n\nYou got your cigarettes\nYou got your jujyfruits\nYou can't stand yourself\nSo you take a substitute\nOhh\nAnd no one liked it when you said\nThat when you die you're really dead\nThose people laughed and\nSo you left that stupid scene\nAnd you made your way back home\nNow you're crying\nWith your head on the telephone\nOh man\nIt'd sure be nice to have a girl to call your own\n\nDo you remember when\nYou had it\nFigured out\nYou coulda\nDone no wrong\nYou coulda\nWorked it out\nOhh\nAnd now you've gazed at too many\nOf the things you did last year\nAnd the screenplay that you wrote down in a book\nThat no one saw cause they never looked\nAnd the drawing you did when you were very small\nAnd the photograph you hung up on the wall\nThey'll never catch you when you fall",
