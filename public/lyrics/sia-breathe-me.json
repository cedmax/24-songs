{"title":"Breathe Me byÂ Sia","lyrics":"Help, I have done it again\nI have been here many times before\nHurt myself again today\nAnd, the worst part is there's no-one else to blame\n\nBe my friend, hold me\nWrap me up, enfold me\nI am small and needy\nWarm me up and breathe me\n\nOuch I have lost myself again\nLost myself and I am nowhere to be found\nYeah I think that I might break\nLost myself again and I feel unsafe\n\nBe my friend, hold me\nWrap me up, enfold me\nI am small and needy\nWarm me up and breathe me\nBe my friend, hold me\nWrap me up, enfold me\nI am small and needy\nWarm me up and breathe me","url":"https://genius.com/Sia-breathe-me-lyrics"}
