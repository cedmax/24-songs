{"songs":"Reform the Countryside by Frog Eyes","lyrics":"Reform your countryside! Reform your shafted side!\nKonstantine: you are the beggar of the blasted blue light\nOh [rich] Richie's in the back\nHe ain't going to like it when you go\nAnd Howard sells the power to the power-hungry proles\nIncriminating photo shoots that show you wearing gold\n\nAll exit patients shall book exit flights\nAnd all the punk cry \"deliver us, deliver us from the night!\"\n\nOh baby, I've got to know, when you sing that song\nWhere the singer sings he's got to know\nI feel this deliverance that is gained from the right\n\nRefrom your countryside!\nBlast they ticks from the blasted side!\nOh twice crooked and twice cursed night\nAll the punks cry \"deliver us, deliver us from the night!\"\n\nShe sings songs\n\nAll hands they roll, they roll to the golden tide\nAnd take that fool out of sight, but then you\nTell him that you got no babies, that he got no babies\nOn and on\n\nRefrom your countryside!\nBlast they ticks from your countryside\nMove thy earth in ways that your father did decide\nAnd all the punks cry deliver us, deliver us from your night\n\nHoward is a whirlwind you wonder where he blows\nA portion of his breath is in this water don't you know\nBold broken promises left oracles in ports\nAnd all the punks cry, \"Deliver us, deliver us from your courts!\"\n\nAh la-la\nYou put the baby in the bottle and then you go\nAnd you sing that song that the General sings to the dawn\nYou put the baby in the bottle and the bottle and you go\nAnd you stand up from your cupboard and you say\nThe world is so!\nAnd you stand up from the river and you see its golden flow\nI am going to pay you a hundred dollars\nYou are going to stay away from the rope\nLa-la-la-la-la-la\nAnd you sing that song that the General sings to the dawn","url":"https://genius.com/Frog-eyes-reform-the-countryside-lyrics"}
