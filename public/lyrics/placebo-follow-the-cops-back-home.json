    "lyrics": "The call to arms was never true\nTime to imbibe, here's to you\nI'll tell you stories bruised and blue\nOf drum machines and landslides\n\nJust one more round before we're through\nMore psychedelic yuppie flu\nIt's such a silly thing to do\nAnd now we're stuck on rewind\n\nLet's follow the cops back home\nFollow the cops back home\nLet's follow the cops back home\nAnd rob their houses\n\nThe call to arms was never true\nLet's take a ride and push it through\nSuspended animation glue\nAnd blame it on apartheid\n\nLet's spend the night in Jimmy Choo's\nI'll give you coats and cheap shampoo\nI'll give you nothing else to do\nAnd now we're stuck on rewind\n\nLet's follow the cops back home\nFollow the cops back home\nLet's follow the cops back home\nAnd rob their houses\nLet's follow the cops back home\nFollow the cops back home\nLet's follow the cops back home\nAnd rob their houses\n\nThe call to arms was never true\nI'm medicated, how are you?\nLet's take a dive swim right through\nSophisticated points of view\n\nLet's follow the cops back home\nFollow the cops back home\nLet's follow the cops back home\nAnd rob their houses\nLet's follow the cops back home\nFollow the cops back home\nLet's follow the cops back home\nAnd rob their houses",
