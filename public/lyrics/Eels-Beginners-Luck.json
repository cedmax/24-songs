{"title":"Beginner's Luck byÂ Eels","lyrics":"All my life I had\nThis funny little feeling\nCame and went time and again\nAmong my daily dealings\n\nCall it a deficit\nAn emptiness inside\nWhy is true love hard to find?\nWhy does true love hide?\n\nBut now I found you and I know that we would be\nSo very happy if you could only see\nThat I was made for you\nAnd you were made for me\n\nThe road in front of us is long and it is wide\nWe've got beginner's luck\nWe've got it on our side (woah)\nIf you are willing well I think i'm qualified\nAnd with beginner's luck we've gotta take the ride\n\nI've got a plan you know\nI've got it all worked out\nAnd all you gotta do is pack your bags\nAnd check your doubts\n\nYou'll come around\nAnd you will see just what I am\nA true love through the worst of times\nA true love till the end\n\nSo now you found me and you've only got to see\nHow complimentary we could really be (woah)\n'Cause I was made for you\nAnd you were made for me\n\nThe road in front of us is long and it is wide\nWe've got beginner's luck\nWe've got it on our side (woah)\nWe will be stronger if our forces are allied\nAnd with beginner's luck we've gotta take the ride\n\nWe'll take the ride\nAs far as anyone can go\nWe'll brave it all\nHand in hand and toe to toe\n\nI've got it all worked out\nDon't worry about a thing\nJust give your hand to me\nAnd here, put on this ring\n\nThe road in front of us is long and it is wide\nWe've got beginner's luck\nWe've got it on our side (woah)\nIf you are willing well I think I'm qualified\nAnd with beginner's luck we've gotta take the ride\n\n(Woah)","url":"https://genius.com/Eels-beginners-luck-lyrics"}
