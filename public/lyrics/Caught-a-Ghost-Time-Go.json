{"title":"Time Go by Caught a Ghost","lyrics":"I'm in need of the answer, searching for questions, love would mean broken-hearted\nDays race by faster, it's a made up lesson and I've lost before I started\nA little white lie, a big black sky, your emptiness open on the dashboard\nYou feel a lack of self and it's someone else telling you to try where you failed before\n\nWhere does the time go? I don't know\nIt's moving off the deep end\nLike I'm moving in slow-mo(tion)\nNow reach, I'll go\nIt passes too quick to see me\n\nLiving on the back nine, living out your past life, trying to make a living as an outlaw\nBut the problem you see, stealing ain't what it used to be, everyone's used to it by now\nYou pack up your gun, make your best run, your thinking isn't breaking any new ground\nBut is there such a thing when you watched the rain, wash away everything that you thought you'd found?\n\nWhere does the time go? I don't know\nIt's moving off the deep end\nLike I'm moving slow-mo(tion)\nNow reach, I'll go\nIt passes too quick to see me\n\nI think that this could be the last one, Jimmy\nWhy don't you come and take this last one with me?\nI gotta say that it's good to be home\nSometimes I miss you when I'm out there alone\nSo come around some time, clear your mind, it's getting harder as the weeks slip away\nYou can turn on a dime, pass you up blind while your waiting for the truth to come your way\n\nYour time will come\nIf you let it be right, if you let it be right\nYour time will come\nIf you let it be right, if you let it be right\nYour time will come\nIf you let it be right, if you let it be right\nYour time will come\nIf you let it be right, if you let it be right","url":"https://genius.com/Caught-a-ghost-time-go-lyrics"}
