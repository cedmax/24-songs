{"songs":"Fading byÂ Gulfer","lyrics":"A faded heart\nThe slowest dance\nI dropped a ten\nThat no one picked up\nI'm getting out\nI'm drying out\nI'm stuck in the house, in always high, the bottom line is amaze me again\n\nRemembering fading\nMy shaking limbs\nI'm lying outside\nI'm hanging all alone\nFeels like the first time\nFeels like forever in so long\n\nI swear i couldn't care less even now\nI mostly waited sick, hating everything\nStarted to cool down, feeling to unimpressed by this whole world\nI caught a stranger running freely, and all i could think was...\nWhatever it takes to be alive\n\nRemembering fading\nMy shaking limbs\nI'm lying outside\nWhatever it takes to be alive","url":"https://genius.com/Gulfer-fading-lyrics"}
