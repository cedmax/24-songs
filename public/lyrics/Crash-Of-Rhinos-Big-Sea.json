{"songs":"Big Sea by Crash Of Rhinos","lyrics":"Where was that luck when we needed it?\nIn these days in which our lives won't lead themselves\nA bright idea\nWhere was that luck when we needed it?\nNow\n\nHalf a chance to make it right\nHalf a chance to fuck it up\n\nWhere was that luck when we needed it?\nWhere was that luck when we needed it?\n\nThis time, it all feels right\nWe'll settle for the better things\nThis time, it all feels right\nWe'll settle for the better things\n\nWe'll stand trial, our will won't be broken\nYour mistake is not that you care, it's that you don't notice\nOur favourite part is not how this ends\nIt's just how it starts\nAnd just that it starts\n\nI'll paint you from my memory","url":"https://genius.com/Crash-of-rhinos-big-sea-lyrics"}
