    "lyrics": "My father was a paper plane, my mother was a windswept tree\nMy little brother's nearly twice my age, he taught me how to meditate\nI taught him how to read\nI grew up with a book in my bed, I got these dark circles before I\nTurned ten\nHeard my mother with her friends worry it was something she did To get such a serious kid\n\nBut I've learned how to paint my face\nHow to earn my keep\nHow to clean my kill\nSome nights I still can't sleep\nThe past rolls back, I can see us still\nYou've learned how to hold your own\nHow to stack your stones\nBut the history's thick\nChildren aren't as simple\nAs we'd like to think\n\nBefore you came along I was a lone cub\nFell in love with language, tried to tell the grown-ups\nAbout the storm clouds, the weather in my head\nHadn't heard the word for melancholy yet\nThen you came in five years behind\nWe thought you couldn't talk, turns out you were just shy\nMom said it was serious, dad said you'd be fine\nI thought you were the prophet of 1989\nYou were so tender, we thought something was wrong with you\nSo patient, we thought that you were deaf\nYou were so solemn, so tiny but so ancient\nMa took you to see doctors, you scared her half to death\nAnd I made you a library of tiny books with spines two inches high\nYou didn't say too much\nBut your smile taught me how to quiet down my mind\n\nBut I've learned how to paint my face\nHow to earn my keep\nHow to clean my kill\nSome nights I still can't sleep\nThe past rolls back, I can see us still\nYou've learned how to hold your own\nHow to stack your stones\nBut the history's thick\nChildren aren't as simple\nAs we'd like to think\n\nYou slept in my bed, and if I kept quiet\nI could hear all the voices in your head\nWhen the wagon tipped\nI prayed over your body, I asked God to take the damage out on me\nTen years later he finally gets the memo, sent it to accounting\nAnd knocked out my front teeth\nBut you came to, and took my hand, and held my eyes and\nMe and you, had a long walk home, so we decided not to cry\nNow we've got a grown-up love\nAnd I know that's how it's supposed to be\nSame old story, mom gets Easters, lets dad have Christmas Eve\nBut I won't pretend I don't remember\nHow unusual we were\nThe little mystic and his handler\nAll some children do is work\n\nI've learned how to paint my face\nHow to earn my keep\nHow to clean my kill\nSome nights I still can't sleep\nThe past rolls back, I can see us still",
