{"title":"Coffee, God And Cigarettes by Mischief Brew","lyrics":"I used to worship whiskey, now I only drink the lord\nAnd I take my coffee, cream and seven sugars\nBefore we meet we stand out on the sidewalk as it pours\nSwappin' one addiction for another\n\nCoffee, God and cigarettes are all that I need\nIt's all that I need just to break this routine\nCoffee, God and cigarettes are all that you need\nIt's all that you need just to be as free as me\n\nWhen I run into me old friends still drinkin' from that cup\nI never stay too long lest I be tempted\nI say you know you drink the devil's brew, you know it's just a crutch\nNo longer must you live your life dependant\n\nCoffee, God and cigarettes are all that I need\nIt's all that I need just to break this routine\nCoffee, God and cigarettes are all that you need\nIt's all that you need just to be as free as me\n\nNow what made me give, turn off the road that ends at the cliff\nTook the car out for a spin, crashed the party, blood run thin\nWas it wakin' up with fifty stitches in my gourd?\nWas it dreamin' about bourbon in the trauma ward?\nWell, I knew I was surely gonna end up dead\nIf I didn't embrace coffee, God and cigarettes\n\nCoffee, God and cigarettes are all that I need\nIt's all that I need just to break this routine\nCoffee, God and cigarettes are all that you need\nIt's all that you need just to be as free as me\n\nHa-ha, I'm going to hell for that one","url":"https://genius.com/Mischief-brew-coffee-god-and-cigarettes-lyrics"}
