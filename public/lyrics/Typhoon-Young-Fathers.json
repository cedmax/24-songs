{"songs":"Young Fathers by Typhoon (band)","lyrics":"I was born in September\nAnd like everything else\nI can’t remember\nI’ll replace it with scenes from the film\nThat I will never know\n\nWhen I blinked it was over\nI was thinking my life will get slower\nThat I will sort this shit out when I’m sober\n(But you can better now that you’re older)\n\nI read the scares on the front page\nIt says we’re waiting around for an ice age\nIt says our comforts they come with a price tag\n(They cured the cancer but discovered a new plague)\n\nI say just think of the children\nAnd imagine the world that we’ve willed them\nIt’s populated with weirdos to kill them\nAnd break their hearts\n\n(And everybody knows)\nThat this is the end\nIt’s never fashionable\nIn a party conversation\n\n(Now I’m as old as you were when you had me\nShould I be afraid\nShould I start a family\nRaise them in the wild ‘cause up against the city\nMy love is such a small thing)\n\nWhen you’re young you have\nYou have your whole life before you\nEveryone will adore you\nGrow up you’ll be an astronaut\n\nOr anything you want\n\nWhat goes up, goes up in flames\nAnd now your choices surround you\nAnd decision confounds you\nAnd you’re pacing around the place\n\nShows you everything you’re not\n\nAnd then the brief little romance\nYou committed a soul without its consent\nTo live a life as a form without its content\n‘Cause young people get old everyday\nYeah young people young people get bored\n\n(Never went to church\nThought a song was gonna save me\nStrumming out a hymn on a guitar that you gave me\nSermon that you spoke will build a fire if you’re smokin’\nAnd our love is just a small thing)\n\nI just called to tell you\nI just called to say\nLearned all your mistakes\nYou were my inspiration\nAnd it wasn’t all we hoped for\nBut we shake it off when we say\nHere’s your yellow ribbon\nI am your consolation\n\nI was born in September\nAnd if I die today\nYou know I don’t regret you\nSome things I can’t explain\n\nIt’s a slow descent\nIt’s a loveless place\nEvery goddamn day\n\nI’m ready to go\nNo matter where you go\nI will follow\nI will follow\nAnywhere you go...\n\nI just called to tell you\nI just called to say\nLearned all your mistakes\nPassed down through generations","url":"https://genius.com/Typhoon-band-young-fathers-lyrics"}
