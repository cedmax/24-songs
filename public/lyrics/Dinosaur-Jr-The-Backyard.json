{"title":"I Expect It Always by Dinosaur Jr.","lyrics":"I expect it always\nI won't hold you down\nComin' at me sideways\nCrumbling from the sound\n\nCenter feeds the subjects\nSeveral times a day\nSinking through the backyard\nThinking doesn't pay\n\nTensions got me thinking\nDrifting made it so\nAll the changes pending\nTraction for the flow\n\nI get there too early\nYou don't feel it's lame\nI get where you're going\nThinking doesn't pay\n\nTested all the way\nTested all the way\nTested all the way\n\nDripped a lot of subjects\nFilеd on a shelf\nTask, you're up to nothing\nMaybe I'm not wеll\n\nFeed me every message\nYou're here all the time\nDrifting through a secret\nNot sure who or why","url":"https://genius.com/Dinosaur-jr-i-expect-it-always-lyrics"}
