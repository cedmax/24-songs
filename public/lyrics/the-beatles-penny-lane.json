    "lyrics": "In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs\nOf every head he's had the pleasure to know\nAnd all the people that come and go\nStop and say hello\n\nOn the corner is a banker with a motorcar\nThe little children laugh at him behind his back\nAnd the banker never wears a mac\nIn the pouring rain\nVery strange\n\nPenny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes\nThere beneath the blue suburban skies\nI sit and meanwhile back\n\nIn Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass\nAnd in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen\nHe likes to keep his fire engine clean\nIt's a clean machine\n\n[Trumpet solo]\n\nPenny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes\nFour of fish and finger pies\nIn summer, meanwhile back\n\nBehind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout\nA pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray\nAnd though she feels as if she's in a play\nShe is anyway\n\nIn Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer\nWe see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim\nAnd then the fireman rushes in\nFrom the pouring rain\nVery strange\n\nPenny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes\nThere beneath the blue suburban skies\nI sit, and meanwhile back\n\nPenny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes\nThere beneath the blue suburban skies\nPenny Lane",
