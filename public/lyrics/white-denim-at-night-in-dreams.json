{"title":"At Night in Dreams by White Denim","lyrics":"Yesterday there was an accident on the street where they held hands\nThey were looking for their hearts\nThey were there from the start, or maybe we\nJust a little too young then to understand\nWhat's easy to advance\nIsn't always made to last, uh, here we are\nA card shufflin' past\nAmbivalence somewhere\nConsidering her half\nAnd he's trying not to laugh when they can see\nThe reckless blood of humanity tempers the quiet\nAnd all the time they spent\nHas led 'em to another end again, again\n\nAt night in dreams\nOf a thousand moons and clear blue rain\nSometimes it seems\nAs if we could build a love to free us from pain\nI know you think\nThat it's easy to change but it's a symptom of age\n\nPortrait of two in white in a church house made of glass\nPlay an imaginary part\nAnd they knew it from the start, now here we are\nBarely holding on to a promise of forever\nMade lying in the grass\nOh, it isn't such a task, or maybe we\nJust a little too cool not to understand\nWhen reason finds its end\nWhere an open heart begins to love again\n\nAt night in dreams\nOf a thousand moons and clear blue rain\nSometimes it seems\nAs if we could build a love to free us from pain\nI know you think\nThat it's easy to change but it's a symptom of age\n\nAt night in dreams\nOf a thousand moons and clear blue rain\nSometimes it seems\nAs if we could build a love to free us from pain\nI know you think\nThat it's easy to change but it's a symptom of age\n\nWe don't move on when we don't have to\nPeople go, we understand\nMore life, more vision\nMore people seeing what they can\n\nAt night in dreams\nOf a thousand moons and clear blue rain\nSometimes it seems\nAs if we could build a love to free us from pain\nI know you think\nThat it's easy to change but it's a symptom of age","url":"https://genius.com/White-denim-at-night-in-dreams-lyrics"}
