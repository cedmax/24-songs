{"title":"Matches by The Format","lyrics":"Ashes to ashes, dust on the dash\nI got my cigarettes\nBut I can't find the fire\nThat's calming me down\n\nI was just out on a night with my friends\nYou are still out on a night with your friends\nAnd you don't seem to tire when I'm not around\n\nI'm under the tunnel, I'm holding my breath\n\nI searched every pocket that hung in the closet\nUntil I found some matches and a brown leather jacket\nOne I swore I'd never worn, but it once kept you warm\n\nDo you remember we made love on the floor?\n\nAnd you still haven't called\nSo I wait until they're closing the bars\n\nI made a wish but the match never lit","url":"https://genius.com/The-format-matches-lyrics"}
