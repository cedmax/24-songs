{"songs":"Trying Soda (I Know You So Well) by Worst Party Ever","lyrics":"I'll find a way to your house\nIt's dark and it's raining, it's nice out\nI'll bite my tongue when your friends around\nWe'll meet at a mall in a new town\nI can't believe that it's dark out\nIt's 6:45 and my headlights\nAre telling me I have to go now\nMy car likes to slide when it's wet and\nMy hands are still cramping\nLess than they were when around you\nI tense all my muscles to your view\nSpend all my time trying soda\nTo tell myself I'm just as new to you\nAnxiety likes to control us\nYou comfort the fact that you're still you\nI am afraid that I know you\nI'm just afraid that I know you\nI'm just afraid that I know you so well\n\nYou'll find a place with a backyard\nA place that you can still run to\nDrinking a lot in the morning\nKnowing that it's gonna kill you\nI'll find a way to go home now\nUnder a bridge self-loathing\nYou can't survive without caffeine\nYour friends aren't enough to be happy, I swear\n\nYour friends aren't enough to be happy, I swear","url":"https://genius.com/Worst-party-ever-trying-soda-i-know-you-so-well-lyrics"}
