{"songs":"A Little Titanic byÂ WHY?","lyrics":"If your shower has a good amount of pressure\nIf you plug your ears, the water hitting your head\nSounds like a screaming school of fish\nOr a crowd of people swimming from a sinking ship\n\nI said it sounds like a screaming school of fish\nOr a crowd of people swimming from a sinking ship\n(Or a crowd of people swimming from a sinking ship)\nOr a set of demons speaking through my leaking lips\n[backwards]\n\nYou're no ghost and you are not salt\nYou're just an overactive man with a [scream]\nThen you deserve a cut for crossing the Bay Bridge\nTo pick up Nosdam from the airport\nI realize that my mind's made up\nMaybe it's coffee that corrupts me into thinking\nThat the motivated and clear-headed\nPeddling but I'm ready for the next leg of the track\nI'm falling towards the target\nEven if the bullseye is a bullet or a car wreck\nI'm not dust yet and I'm not fog\nI'm an unattractive man\nBut I got a ring on my right hand\nCuz I'm a singer in a rock and roll band\nIt sounds pathetic\nBut to tell the truth\nI don't regret it\n\nI fucked your girlfriend and I'd probably do it again\nYou slashed my tires and I'd hope that you would do it again\nI stole your records and I haven't even written them yet\nI lost your number and I changed all the locks\nAnd all I feel is guilty as I rubberneck a wreck on the highway","url":"https://genius.com/Why-a-little-titanic-lyrics"}
