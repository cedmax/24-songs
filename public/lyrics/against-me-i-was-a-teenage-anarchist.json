{"title":"I Was a Teenage Anarchist by Against Me!","lyrics":"I was a teenage anarchist\nLooking for a revolution\nI had the style, I had the ambition\nRead all the authors, I knew the right slogans\nThere was no war but the class war\nI was ready to set the world on fire\nI was a teenage anarchist\nLooking for a revolution\n\nDo you remember\nWhen you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?\nDo you remember\nWhen you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?\n\nI was a teenage anarchist\nBut the politics were too convenient\nIn the depths of their humanity\nAll I saw was bloodless ideology\nWith freedom as the doctrine\nGuess who was the new authority?\nI was a teenage anarchist\nBut the politics were too convenient\n\nDo you remember\nWhen you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?\nDo you remember\nWhen you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?\nWhen you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?\n\nI was a teenage anarchist\nBut then the scene got too rigid\nIt was a mob mentality\nThey set their rifle sights on me\nNarrow visions of autonomy\nYou wanted me to surrender my identity\nI was a teenage anarchist\nThe revolution was a lie\n\nDo you remember\nWhen you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?\nDo you remember\nWhen you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?\nWhen you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?\nWhen you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?\n\nI was a teenage anarchist\nI was a teenage anarchist\nI was a teenage anarchist\nI was a teenage anarchist","url":"https://genius.com/Against-me-i-was-a-teenage-anarchist-lyrics"}
