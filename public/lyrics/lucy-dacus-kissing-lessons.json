    "lyrics": "Rachel was a year older\nWhen I was in the second grade\nI thought she might know everything\nI took her word like a golden ring\nI asked her how to win my man\nAnd she said, \"I know just the thing\"\nGave me lip gloss and a hair toss\nAnd after school, a lesson in kissing\n\nShe called me by the name of a crush\nI couldn't decide if she was Cole or Justin\nI think I called her baby or darling most the time\n\nWe'd take turns being seduced\nImagining the day it would come into use\nImagining thе day we'd start breaking hearts\nAnd taking namеs\n\nShe wanted a three-story house\nI wanted to live by a body of water\nWith my children and their father\nChildren and their father\nThree sons and a beautiful daughter (Oh)\n\n\nRachel's family moved out of town\nI don't remember when we stopped hanging out\nBut I still wear a letter R charm on my bracelet\nAnd wonder if she thinks of me as her first kiss",
