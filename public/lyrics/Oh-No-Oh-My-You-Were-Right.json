{"title":"You Were Right by Oh No Oh My","lyrics":"Illuminate me when you need it\nOpposites attract don't you know\nI was in the current when the creek hit my flow\nAnd won't you stop your hanging around while the coffee's getting warm\nHappiness is it so keep it close when it's around\nYou try you try why don't you hurry up\nIt's always something\nIt's all worth something\nI don't believe you when you say you were right\nDon't forget me when you've made it\nDon't forget we celebrated\nYour birthday and New Years Eve\nThere was so much to talk about back then\nI was the one who apologized for being honest from the start\nI was on the upward stride when the moon hit my tide\nYou try you try why don't you hurry up\nIt's always something\nIt's all worth something\nI don't believe you when you say you were right\nWon't you stop your hanging around while the coffee's getting warm\nHappiness is it so keep it close when its around\nYou try you try why don't you hurry up\nIt's always something\nIt's all worth something\nI don't believe you when you say you were right","url":"https://genius.com/Oh-no-oh-my-you-were-right-lyrics"}
