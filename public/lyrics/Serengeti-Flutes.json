{"title":"Flutes by Serengeti","lyrics":"[Verse 1: Serengeti]\nHey, Geti King\nSpaghetti string snipped- boob fell out of it;\nExcuse me, ma’am, I see your ham\nI hope the gods don’t curse me, damn\nI like it like I found a bike\nThe prettiest thing I seen tonight\nPrettiest thing I saw in years\nIncluding ghosts and volunteers\nThey couch surfed and loved dessert\nOrder sweet and gather skirts\nEven prettier than them\nPrettier than a precious gem\nPretty as an onion stem\nOr weekends at the MGM\nI can’t see why your strap is snipped\nI’m not complaining, not a bit\nI’m not\nI’m not\n\n[Verse 2: Serengeti]\nKing Floyd attacked and destroyed a convoy\nThat was carrying LaCroix and also little kid’s toys\nI made a mistake;\nI also poisoned an artificial lake\nIt wasn’t my best moment\nSo at night the king lies awake\nFloyd-\nMy father’s middle name too\nI hated it growing up\nSo I said my second name was Lou\nThere’s pressure having a realm in my old forest of Elm\nPlus when you make a mistake you felt overwhelmed\nI was feeling sorta sick\nMy excuse: I made a mess of it\nI’m not complaining, not a bit\nI’m not complaining, not a bit\nI’m not\nI’m not\nI’m not\nI’m not complaining, not a bit\nI’m not complaining, not a bit\nI’m not","url":"https://genius.com/Serengeti-flutes-lyrics"}
