  "lyrics": "It's nothing I regret\nSave it for another day\n'cause the school is out\nAnd the kids have run away\n\nI would like a place\nI can call my own\nHave a conversation on a telephone\nWake up everyday\nThat would be a start\nI would not complain\nOn my wounded heart\n\nI was upset, you see\nAlmost all the time\nYou used to be a stranger\nNow you are mine\n\nI wouldn't even trust you\nI've not that much to give\nWe're dealing in the limits\nAnd we don't know who with\n\nYou may think that I'm out of hand\nThat I'm naive, I'll understand\nOn this occasion\nIt's not true\nLook at me\nI'm not you\n\nI would like a place\nI can call my own\nHave a conversation on the telephone\nWake up everyday\nThat would be a start\nI would not complain\nOf my wounded heart\n\nI was a short fuse\nBurning all the time\nYou were a complete stranger\nNow you are mine\n\nI would like a place\nI can call my own\nHave a conversation on the telephone\nWake up everyday\nThat would be a start\nI would not complain\nOf my wounded heart\n\nJust wait 'till tomorrow\nI guess that's what they all say\nJust before they fall apart\nAlone",
