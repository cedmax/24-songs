{"songs":"Little Awkward Moments byÂ Keywest","lyrics":"Little awkward moments\nLittle jokes you make\nYou like to watch me sweat\nBecause there's so much ice to break\n\nBut in your smile I see something\nSomething you can't fake\nSo baby win or lose\nI like the game we play\n\nWhen I first kissed you\nI was a little bit nervous\nDidn't go quite right\nBut practice makes perfect\nSo baby don't give up on me\nAnd I won't give up on you\nBecause we could be something brand new\n\nI feel a little bit cautious and stand off ish\nI am confused\nI can't paint you a picture with magic\nThis song can help you imagine\nJust how our story could go\nNo pressure, don't panic\nMost love stories end tragic\nYou'll never know if you say no\nSo don't say no\n\nThis is not what should be\nThis is just what could be\nIf you don't say no\n\nLets see the West End in London\nAnd eat pizza in Rome\nWe'll drink wine in Paris baby\nMake love when we're home\nAnd you'll wake up to roses every February 14\nYou'll get a little blue box at Christmas\nAnd every New Year we can go ski-ing\n\nI feel a little bit cautious and stand off ish\nI am confused\nPaint you a picture with magic\nThis song can help you imagine\nJust how our story could go\nNo pressure, don't panic\nMost love stories end tragic\nYou'll never know if you say no\nSo don't say no\n\nSo don't tell me to wake up\nAnd don't you tell me I'm dreaming\nGive me a chance just to make up\nFor lost time and show you what I'm feeling\n\nI know you think I'm hopeless\nBut you can't tell me to give up\nBecause I know when I'm in love\n\nAnd maybe if we make it\nWe can marry in June\nWe'll have a beautiful outdoor reception\nWhere all the roses in summertime bloom\n\nAnd if you have a baby girl\nI know I'm screwed\nBecause she'll break my heart every day of her life\nIf she looks just like you","url":"https://genius.com/Keywest-little-awkward-moments-lyrics"}
