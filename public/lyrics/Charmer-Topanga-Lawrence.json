{"songs":"Topanga Lawrence byÂ Charmer","lyrics":"Could you please not fall asleep\nTo the title screen\nOf your favorite movie?\nI'm sorry for when I leave\nI just can't deal with your body heat touching me\n\nThe distance between our house\nDoesn't matter to me right now\nSo I'll bring my shoes up to your room\nSo your friends don't know I'm with you\n\nTopanga, why'd you get too cool?\nPlease invite me over\nTo get high in your bedroom\nIs it normal for people to move on to better things?\nBut I'm still not over you\n\nThe distance between our house\nDoesn't matter to me right now\nSo I'll bring my shoes up to your room\nSo your friends don't know I'm with you\n\nTopanga, why'd you get too cool?\nPlease invite me over\nTo get high in your bedroom\nIs it normal for people to move on to better things?\nBut I'm still in love with you","url":"https://genius.com/Charmer-topanga-lawrence-lyrics"}
