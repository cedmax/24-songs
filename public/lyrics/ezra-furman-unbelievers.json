{"title":"Unbelievers by Ezra Furman","lyrics":"Got a little soul\nThe world is a cold, cold place to be\nWant a little warmth\nBut who’s gonna save a little warmth for me?\n\nWe know the fire awaits unbelievers\nAll of the sinners the same\nGirl, you and I will die unbelievers\nBound to the tracks of the train\n\nIf I’m born again I know that the world will disagree\nWant a little grace but who’s gonna say a little grace for me?\n\nWe know the fire awaits unbelievers\nAll of the sinners the same\nGirl, you and I will die unbelievers\nBound to the tracks of the train\n\nI’m not excited, but should I be?\nIs this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?\nI know I love you\nAnd you love the sea\nBut what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me?\n\nSee the sun go down\nIt’s going on down, and the night is deep\nWant a little light\nBut who’s gonna save a little light for me?\n\nWe know the fire awaits unbelievers\nAll of the sinners the same\nGirl, you and I will die unbelievers\nBound to the tracks of the train\n\nI’m not excited, but should I be?\nIs this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?\n\nI know I love you\nAnd you love the sea\nBut what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me?\n\nI’m not excited, but should I be?\nIs this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?\n\nI know I love you\nAnd you love the sea\nBut what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me?","url":"https://genius.com/Ezra-furman-unbelievers-lyrics"}
