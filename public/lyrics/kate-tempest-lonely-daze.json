{"title":"Lonely Daze by Kae Tempest","lyrics":"Pete is a young man\nHeart full of rain\nEyes full of evenings\nSpent in a dream\nGrew up in a city where you master your pain\nOr you end up numb, not feeling\n\nBecky is a young woman\nHeart full of earth\nEyes full of mornings\nSpent without sleeping\nGrew up in a city where it’s hard to be heard\nAnd nothing really has much meaning\n\nPete had his heart broke once\nHe never fixed it\nSits there in his chest\nWith his arms crossed, screwing\nBecky had her heart broke twice\nShe won’t risk it again\nShe don’t wanna see her heart get ruined\n\nAnd now she’s on her way\nTo wash up and take the orders\nFor spaghetti\nAt Giuseppe’s\nThe café on the corner\nShe did the night shift too\nA masseuse at the sauna\nShe’s putting herself through uni\nIt’s hard work\n\nBut will it be this way forever?\nThese are lonely days\nWhat if she could be the one that makes it better?\nHe looks away, can’t hold her gaze\nBut will it be this way forever?\nThese are stressful times\nWhat if he could be the one that gets her?\nShe looks away, she’s petrified\n\n‘Now, have you thought about retail?’\n‘Yes, fine with me’\n‘Oh and I can see here that you have a degree’\n‘Yes,’ says Pete, ‘in International Relations.’\n‘Great\nLet’s see if Primark has space for a placement.’\n\nBecky clears up from the lunch rush Crushed\nBy the blank eyes\nImpolite customers thrusting\nTheir damp fives\nInto her palms, she thinks\n'There ain’t no harm in being civil though, Is there?'\n\nHe folds up his job form\nGets up from his chair\nThe next person sits down with a similar air\nOf dejection\nHe walks out, heads in the direction\nOf the café on the corner\nFor a coffee and some headroom\n\nThis guy comes in\nThe first customer to close the door behind him For that alone she likes him\nHe sits at the table by the window\nReading, half smiling\nHis hair’s messy and his eyes are shining\n\nCan’t think what to say, he just stares blankly\nPicks up his change, fiddles with his spoon\nAnd as he leaves the café he’s consumed\nWith thoughts of her\nWishing that he’d got up the guts\nTo try and talk to her\n\nIt’s Becky’s mate’s birthday\nThey’re out for the night\nNow, Becky’s mate is the nightmare type\nShe’d flirt with anyone\nScream at the top of her voice\nBut it’s her birthday so Becky\nDon’t really have a choice\n\nHe sees her in the queue\nHe doesn’t know what to do\nShe’s more beautiful than he remembers\nThen she says\n‘Alright?’\nAnd he tries to say something funny\nBut stutters\nAnd now he feels like a muppet and blushes (No, No, No)\n\nInside it’s the usual scene\nThey’re dancing at the bar, waiting to get served\nBecky’s mate’s screaming about something absurd\nAnd they’re all fake laughing\nEven though nobody heard a word\n\nSo now he’s hunting around the room\nStaring into every booth\nThe back of every head could be hers\nIt’s no use\nHe stops by the bar, thinking\n'Man, I’ll never find her'\nAnd then he realises that he’s standing beside her\n\nHe stands there awkward\nHis eyes are as loud as the bass\nAnd she can recognise something in his face\nShe scribbles down her number\nLingering glance\nAnd lets herself think\nMaybe this could be her chance","url":"https://genius.com/Kae-tempest-lonely-daze-lyrics"}
