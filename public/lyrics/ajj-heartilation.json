    "lyrics": "I wanna break apart my heart\nGlue the pieces to my car\nCrash it into a wall\nI don't want to feel at all\nI want to break apart my heart\nDouse it in gasoline\nSo the fire burns clean\nFlick a cigarette like that movie Con Air\nDoused in gasoline\n\nAnd if you think you are better than me\nYou're right\nThere's no one to love\nThere's no one to trust\nIn my life\n\nI want to pick up the pieces\nAnd plant them in the ground\nWhen a tree grows there\nI want to chop that tree down\nBuild it into a boat\nAnd float it in a lake\nAnd with dynamite\nI will explode that thing\nThat makes me make mistakes\n\nAnd if you think you are better than me\nYou're right\nThere's no one to love\nThere's no one to trust\nIn my life\n\nSometimes I get so lonesome\nI can't breathe\nSometimes I get so scared\nThat I can't speak\nSometimes I get so worried\nI can't hear my heart beat\nAnyway, anyway\n\nI wanna tear out my heart\nAnd give it away\nTo a person more deserving one day\nAnd if all I see\nIs the worst in everything\nThat's all I'm gonna get\nThat's all I'm gonna get\nThat's all I'm gonna get\n\nAnd if you think you are better than me\nYou're right\nThere's no one to love\nThere's no one to trust\nIn my life\nThere's no one to love\nNo one to trust\nIn my life\nNo one to love\nThere's no one to trust\nIn my life",
