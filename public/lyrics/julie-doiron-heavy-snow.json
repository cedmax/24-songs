{"title":"Heavy Snow by Julie Doiron","lyrics":"Oh heavy snow, bury me tonight\nIn the place where our bikes lay\nLovers in the night time\nLovers in the day\nOh heavy sleep, carry me away\nTo the place where dreams speak\nWorking in the night time\nWorking in the day\n\nOh heavy heart, forgive me\nMake me feel like it's all okay\nLiving through the night and\nLiving through the day\n\nOh heavy wind, come for me today\nMake me feel like he once did\nOh come for me today\nOh","url":"https://genius.com/Julie-doiron-heavy-snow-lyrics"}
