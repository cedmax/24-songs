{"title":"A Real Hero by College (Ft. Electric Youth)","lyrics":"Real human being\nAnd a real hero\n\nBack against the wall and odds\nWith the strength of a will and a cause\nYour pursuits are called outstanding\nYou're emotionally complex\nAgainst the grain of dystopic claims\nNot the thoughts your actions entertain\nAnd, you have proved to be\nA real human being\nAnd, a real hero\n\nReal human being\nAnd, a real hero\nReal human being\nAnd, a real hero\nReal human being\nAnd, a real hero\n\nA pilot on a cold, cold morn'\n155 people on board\nAll safe and all rescued\nFrom the slowly sinking ship\nWater warmer than his head so cool\nIn that tight bind knew what to do\nAnd, you have proved to be\nA real human being\n\nReal human being\nAnd, a real hero\nReal human being\nAnd, a real hero\nReal human being\nAnd, a real hero\nReal human being\nAnd, a real hero","url":"https://genius.com/College-a-real-hero-lyrics"}
