{"songs":"We Dance byÂ Pavement","lyrics":"There is no\nCastration fear\nIn a chair\nYou will be\nWith me\n\nWe'll dance\nWe'll dance\nWe'll dance\nWe'll dance\n\nBut no one will dance with us\nIn this zany town\n\nChim chim chim sing a song of praise\nFor your elders\nThey're in the back\n\nPick out some Brazilian nuts\nFor your engagement\nCheck that expiration date man\nIt's later than you think\n\nYou can't enjoy yourself\nI can't enjoy myself\nYou can't enjoy yourself\nI can't enjoy myself\n\nMove that swing\nAnd watch it break straight like an arc\nBut I won't be there to leave you\nCause I don't have a clue anymore\n\nMaybe we could dance\nMaybe we could dance\nMaybe we could dance\nTogether\nTogether\nTogether\n\nFirst time you see\nAnd then you'll be\nFive times forever\nAnd you never get lost","url":"https://genius.com/Pavement-we-dance-lyrics"}
