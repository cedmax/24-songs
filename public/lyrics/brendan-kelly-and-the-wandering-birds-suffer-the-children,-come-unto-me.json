{"title":"Suffer the Children, Come Unto Me by Brendan Kelly and the Wandering Birds","lyrics":"What’s a pretty little thing like you\nDoin' in this dingy old back room?\nI got some candy\nA piece for every bruise\nYou can grab it if it’s handy, cuz any cock’ll do\nNow dance to the beat of the slow, slow turn\nOf the world as it weeps in this slow, slow burn\nAnd the shoes on your feet ain’t set to return\nI’m the one who’s walking out alone\nYou won’t need those sandals where you’re going\nCuz little baby, you ain’t ever goin' home\n\nAnd the last sounds that you’ll ever know\nAre the vultures crying \"Whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa-no\"\nAnd soon they’ll be picking at your bones\nThey'll be picking at your bones\nThey'll be picking at your bones\nWhoa-whoa-whoa\n\nI caught you in the bathroom in a real wide stance\nI caught you down by the lagoon with my hands down your pants\nOn an old dirty mattress with stains and yellow scarves\nI start out watching then I get so hard\nAnd you won’t need that mattress where you’re going\nAnd I’m the one who’s walking out alone\nAnd mister, you ain’t ever going home\n\nCause the last sound that you’ll ever know\nIs my bonesaw grinding \"Whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa-no\"\nSoon we’ll be chipping at your bones\nWe'll be chipping at your bones\nWe'll be chipping at your bones\nWhoa-whoa-whoa\n\nEvery single plan I make has been informed by these sour grapes\nI’ve got one last death to fake before I settle down\nOn the last burning block of the last burning town\nWhere the devil and behemoth have been hanging around\nAnd I don’t miss that old crowd\nI do not miss that old crowd\nSo goddamned lazy and loud\n\nAnd the last sound that I’ll ever know is my heart exploding\n\"Whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa-no\"\nSoon I’ll be nothing but these bones\nI'll be nothing but these bones\nI'll be nothing but these bones\nI don’t need this bullshit where I’m going\nAnd I don’t think I’m ever going home\nAnd I’m the one who’s walking out alone\nSo bitch, quit your fucking crying","url":"https://genius.com/Brendan-kelly-and-the-wandering-birds-suffer-the-children-come-unto-me-lyrics"}
