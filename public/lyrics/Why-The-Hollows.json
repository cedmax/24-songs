{"songs":"The Hollows by WHY? (Ft. Doseone)","lyrics":"[Verse 1: Yoni Wolf]\nAs I lay me down to fall asleep\nWith my demons dying\nAnd my pilot light weak\nI curse the last six months\nI've been hiding behind a mustache\nYeah\nAnd to those last 10 years\nI've been howling a paper moon\nWell fuck you\n\n[Chorus 1: Yoni Wolf & Doseone]\nThis goes out to all my underdone\nOther-tongued\nLung-long frontmen\n(This is what the ghost of someone's dad says)\nAnd all us earth growths\nSome planted\nAnd some pulled\n(Shut up and put your money where your mouth is)\n\n[Verse 2: Yoni Wolf]\nYou shine a flashlight in\nA hat box and spin\nAn empty oyster shell\nAnd celebrate the hollows\n\n[Chorus 2: Yoni Wolf & Doseone]\nThis goes out to dirty-dancing, cursing\nBack-masking, back-slidden pastor's kids\n(From behind bars its not so hard to see he's risen)\nAnd all us earth growths\nSome planted\nAnd some pulled\n(Nobody finds god and then goes to prison)\n\n[Verse 3: Yoni Wolf]\nIn Berlin I saw two men fuck\nIn the dark corner of a basketball court\nJust a slight jingle\nOf pocket change pulsing\nIn the tourist park I lost 50 euros\nTo a guy with the walnut shells\nAnd the marble\nIt really pissed me off\nSo I thought I'd go back\nTo get my money\nBut all my homies warned me\n\"Oh no, those gypsies\nProlly got knives\"\n\n[Chorus 3: Yoni Wolf & Doseone]\nThis goes out to all my under-brewed\nDouble-duped, two-time truth-fools\n(Stop thinking a phone call\nOr text is too complicated)\nAnd all us earth growths\nSome planted\n(Like a married uncle at a family function)\nAnd some pulled\n\n[Bridge: Yoni Wolf]\nI got them shaky gums and a couple of loose tooths\nNow tell me what should I do?\nMy God, the clock's always\nStuck tellin' 11:11, at 3:32\n\n[Chorus 1: Yoni Wolf & Doseone]\nEven just Joanna Newsom's left hand\n(I could beat the pants in bass off your best man)\n\n[Chorus 1: Yoni Wolf & Doseone]\n(This is what the ghost of someone's dad says)\nAnd all us earth growths\nDoin' the croak\nLike it ain't no joke\n\n[Outro]\nIn a crowded room projected debonair\nAloof impermanence\nHe shrouded loosely\nIn a heavy air of indeterminance","url":"https://genius.com/Why-the-hollows-lyrics"}
