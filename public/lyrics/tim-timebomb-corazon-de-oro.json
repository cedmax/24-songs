{"lyrics":"It's over before it starts, oh don't you know\nSo on your marks, stand by; Ready, go\nFrom London to New York, Montreal to Tokyo\nI see visions of her everywhere I go\nWhat have I become?\nNow that I'm all alone\n\nI'm just looking for a way to break through these walls and\nI'm just looking for a place that I can call my home and\nIs anybody out there got a soul?\nCause I'm just looking for a girl, the girl with a heart of gold\n\nShe overturns once again with her, oh with her champagne taste she goes\nStraight down the rat hole with her total recklessness\nTomorrow will come on through, and I got nothing but a bad intention\nNothing but a silhouette girl - Met her in darkness\n\nI say.. What have I become?\nNow that I'm all alone\n\nI'm just looking for a way to break through these walls and\nI'm just looking for a place that I can call my home and\nIs anybody out there got a soul?\nCause I'm just looking for a girl, the girl with a heart of gold\n\nYeah I'm in the corner I start over - I start the whole thing clean, yeah\nAll the pain and heartache in all my years, I was always to blame\nAnd I dream of this girl - yeah an angelical ghost\nI met dancing through my neighborhood\nI'm a downtown member in a front line - Don't let me be misunderstood\nOh, I'm a downtown member in a front line - Don't let me be misunderstood\n\n(Heart of gold!)\n\nI'm just looking for a way to break through these walls and\nI'm just looking for a place that I can call my home and\nIs anybody out there got a soul?\nCause I'm just looking for a girl, the girl with a heart of gold","url":"https://genius.com/Rancid-corazon-de-oro-lyrics"}
