{"title":"Anxiety Attack by Jeffrey Lewis","lyrics":"I lay down every night\nAnd I can't get no rest\n'Cause it starts spinning in my brain\nAnd then it's pounding in my chest\nWhat if I've wasted all my youth?\nWhat if I've wasted growing up?\nWhat if I wasted my whole life?\nOh man, I feel like throwing up\n\nIt's an anxiety attack\nAn anxiety attack\nI've got a bad case of the horrors\nAnd at night it comes back\n\n'Cause first I look back at my week\nAnd then I look back at my year\nAnd then I'm terrified to speak\nAnd then I'm paralyzed with fear\nAnd I'm tossing and I'm turning\nAnd I'm going 'round the bend\nAnd all I see are all my failings\nDownward spirals without end\nAnd I see horror in the future\nAnd I see horror in the past\nAnd it's 4am and 5am, 6am at last\n\n'Cause what if I never feel grown up\nAnd die in a car accident?\nAnd what if I go crazy\nAnd what if this time it's permanent?\nAnd what if I go broke\nAnd have to move back with my parents?\nAnd then what if I get cancer\nAnd I ain't got no insurance?\n\nAll my days are moving faster\nAnd it's making me feel dizzy\nHow come I get nothing done\nBut always feel so busy?\nAnd I used to feel so smart\nYou know, I used to feel so strong\nBut this just can't be how to live\nI must be doing something wrong\nBecause everything I might do\nFeels like something else I can't\nAnd then another day is gone\nAnd I just don't know where it went\n\nI try not to hang out too much\nTry not to watch too much television\nBut still everything I do\nJust seems to be the wrong decision\nAnd I lay down every night\nBut still I can't get no rest\n'Cause it starts spinning in my brain\nAnd then it's pounding in my chest\n\nIt's an anxiety attack\nAn anxiety attack\nI've got a bad case of the horrors\nAnd at night it comes back","url":"https://genius.com/Jeffrey-lewis-anxiety-attack-lyrics"}
