{"title":"Holocaust Of Giants by Rasputina","lyrics":"When I was nine years old\nWay back in Ohio\nThe hired man was digging up a well\nOn my father's land\nHe found a fossil there\n\nIt was a massive bone\nAnd since then I’ve known\nThat a race of giants lived in the northern hemisphere\nTen thousand years ago they lived right here\n\nIt seems incredible\nBut yet it's the truth\nThat a fossilized and petrified\nCalcified primeval brute\n\nWas turned to stone\nBut he was not alone\nThere were hundreds of them walking on the sand toward river\nEven giants think they'll always live forever\n\nYa da da de\nYa da da da da de\nYa da da de\nYa da da da da de\nYa da da de\nYa da da da da de\n\nWhere a stream once flowed\nInto the Ohio\nEverything was turned to stone\nWoah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\n\nThe bible speaks of this\nThere were giants in our midst\nBut they slaughtered one another in a meaningless war\nThank your lucky stars that we don't do that anymore\n\nThat gravel-encrusted skull\nThat was found on a river shoal\nDouble rows of very sharp teeth\nThe massive jaw measured twenty-five feet\n\nWell it's turned to stone\nThere were hundreds of them walking on the sand toward river\nEven giants think they'll always live forever\n\nHey-hey-ay-e-ah\nOh-hey-e-ay-e-aye\nAh-ay-e-ay-ah-oh-a-oh\nHey-hey-ay-e-ah\nOh-hey-e-ay-e-aye\nAh-ay-e-ay-ah-oh-a-oh\n\nThe bible speaks of this\nThere were giants in our midst\nBut they slaughtered one another in a meaningless war\nThank your lucky stars that we don't do that anymore\n\nThat gravel-encrusted skull\nThat was found on a river shoal\nDouble rows of very sharp teeth\nThe massive jaw measured twenty-five feet\n\nWell it's turned to stone\nThere were hundreds of them walking on the sand toward the river\nEven giants think they'll always live forever","url":"https://genius.com/Rasputina-holocaust-of-giants-lyrics"}
