{"songs":"Should Have Known Better by Sufjan Stevens","lyrics":"I should have known better\nTo see what I could see\nMy black shroud\nHolding down my feelings\nA pillar for my enemies\n\nI should have wrote a letter\nAnd grieve what I happen to grieve\nMy black shroud\nI never trust my feelings\nI waited for the remedy\n\nWhen I was three, three, maybe four\nShe left us at that video store\nOh, be my rest, be my fantasy\nOh, be my rest, be my fantasy\n\nI’m light as a feather\nI’m bright as the Oregon breeze\nMy black shroud\nFrightened by my feelings\nI only wanna be a relief\n\nNo, I’m not a go-getter\nThe demon had a spell on me\nMy black shroud\nCaptain of my feelings\nThe only thing I wanna believe\n\nWhen I was three, and free to explore\nI saw her face on the back of the door\nOh, be my rest, be my fantasy\nOh, be my rest, be my fantasy\n\nI should have known better\nNothing can be changed\nThe past is still the past\nThe bridge to nowhere\nI should have wrote a letter\nExplaining what I feel, that empty feeling\n\nDon’t back down, concentrate on seeing\nThe breakers in the bar, the neighbor’s greeting\nMy brother had a daughter\nThe beauty that she brings, illumination\n\nDon’t back down, there is nothing left\nThe breakers in the bar, no reason to live\nI’m a fool in the fetter (fool in the fetter)\nRose of Aaron’s beard, where you can reach me\n\nDon’t back down: nothing can be changed\nCantilever bridge, the drunken sailor\nMy brother had a daughter (brother had a daughter)\nThe beauty that she brings, illumination (illumination)\nIllumination","url":"https://genius.com/Sufjan-stevens-should-have-known-better-lyrics"}
