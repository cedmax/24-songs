{"songs":"Valentine's Deuce byÂ Gamemast15r","lyrics":"[Produced by Jake One]\n\n[Intro]\nTwenty men were found dead, filled with bullets in a garage on the slummier side of town. Reports said they were doing a drug deal and that there were no witnesses to who could've done it. The authorities have stated it was probably just a case of a bunch of low class drug dealers involved in a drug deal gone wrong. Back to Madison for the weather reports\n\n[Hook x2]\nBitch I'm bustin' at him; bitch I'm bustin' at him\nPow Pow Pow, gotta shoot all of them mothafuckas\n\n[Verse 1]\nI suit up, it's nice out; deuce up, and Iced out\nHad a couple of stalkers, gonna make me pull my knife out\nSmall time but no matter, gonna cut their lights out\nGamble with my life, then I gotta bring my dice out\nSo I gotta send fear to the heart of those who oppose me\nThe same ones who plot can't hide behind their rosary\nI'm a changed man, who hides behind the same tan\nThe same cold eyes that hides behind the ray bans\nGotta cut out competition, and I know how to do it\nPut em' in a line and fire up, ain't no ways to lose it\nDress up as the boys in blue, under a false arrest\nUnder the guise of selling coke, blood up on the walls and vest\nMac-11's won't do, sipping on a cold brew\nBut AK's are a good choice, chop you up, turn you into tofu\nThe angels stare down on me and all they do is weep\nClose they eyelids, rest in peace, I pray to god you go to sleep\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo the plan starts out fine enough, the diamonds in the rough\nKnow where they be going to, then they go to line em' up\nWhen they open the garage doors more then was expected\nIt's hectic, bullet's flying, the plan is being dissected\nSo what am I supposed to do, a bunch of my boys killed\nWe got a rat in the house, cause we only employ skilled\nI role with professionals who don't go to confessionals\nAnd all of their backgrounds are very credible\nExcept one motherfucker who I wasn't one hundred with\nAnd I'm a hunter, shit he better know who he's fucking wit'\nI guess I gotta settle the score, for better or worse\nIt goes slow-mo with the fo-fo, better withdraw\nPull out every gun that I got just to salvage this shit\nThe motherfuckers try to run but I got piles of clips\nI shoot through every single one, from bone to ligaments\nThis shit has gotten to be one unholy predicament\n\n[Outro: (Noises), Henchman, [Kane]]\n(Shells falling)\nOh shit!! The po's!! We gotta go Kane\n[Aight, let's go]\n(Steps of running)","url":"https://genius.com/Gamemast15r-valentines-deuce-lyrics"}
