  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nTraveling in a fried-out Kombi\nOn a hippie trail, head full of zombie\nI met a strange lady, she made me nervous\nShe took me in and gave me breakfast\nAnd she said\n\n[Chorus 1]\nDo you come from a land down under\nWhere women glow and men plunder\nCan't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?\nYou better run, you better take cover\n\n[Verse 2]\nBuying bread from a man in Brussels\nHe was six-foot-four and full of muscles\nI said, \"Do you speak-a my language?\"\nHe just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich\nAnd he said\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI come from a land down under\nWhere beer does flow and men chunder\nCan't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?\nYou better run, you better take cover, yeah\n\n[Verse 3]\nLyin' in a den in Bombay\nWith a slack jaw, and not much to say\nI said to the man, \"Are you trying to tempt me\nBecause I come from the land of plenty?\"\nAnd he said\n\n[Chorus 1]\nDo you come from a land down under (Oh yeah yeah)\nWhere women glow and men plunder\nCan't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?\nYou better run, you better take cover\n\nLiving in a land down under\nWhere women glow and men plunder\nCan't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?\nYou better run, you better take cover\n\nLiving in a land down under\nWhere women glow and men plunder\nCan't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?\nYou better run, you better take cover\n\nLiving in a land down under\nWhere women glow and men plunder\nCan't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?\nYou better run, you better take cover",
