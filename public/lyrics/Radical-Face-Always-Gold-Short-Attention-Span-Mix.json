  "lyrics": "We were tight knit boys\nBrothers in more then name\nYou would kill for me\nAnd knew that I'd do the same\nAnd it cut me sharp\nHearing you'd gone away\n\nBut everything goes away\nYeah everything goes away\n\nBut I'm going to be here until I'm nothing\nBut bones in the ground\n\nAnd I was there, when you grew restless\nLeft in the dead of night\nAnd I was there, when three months later\nYou were standing in the door all beat and tired\nAnd I stepped aside\n\nEverything goes away\nYeah everything goes away\nBut I'm gonna be here until I'm nothing\nBut bones in the ground\nSo quiet down\n\nWe were opposites at birth\nI was steady as a hammer\nNo one worried 'cause they knew just where I'd be\nAnd they said you were the crooked kind\nAnd that you'd never have no worth\nBut you were always gold to me\n\nAnd back when we were kids\nWe swore we knew the future\nAnd our words would take us half way 'round the world\nBut I never left this town\nAnd you never saw New York\nAnd we ain't ever cross the sea\n\nBut I am fine with where I am now\nThis home is home, and all that I need\nBut for you, this place is shame\nBut you can blame me when there's no one left to blame\n\nOh I don't mind\n\nAll my life\nI've never known where you've been\nThere were holes in you\nThe kind that I could not mend\n\nAnd I heard you say\nRight when you left that day\nDoes everything go away?\nYeah, everything goes away.\n\nBut I'm going to be here 'til forever\nSo just call when you're around.",
