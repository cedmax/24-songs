{"title":"The Grey Estates by Wolf Parade","lyrics":"Darling please\nLet's get out of here\nOn a train to who knows where\nI've got a feeling that I can't explain\nWe had to leave this place\nWe won't be back again\nGetting tired of landscapes\nWe're just floating\nRolling past the grey estates\n\nWhat put the fire in his stomach out\nWhat moved its hands all across your mouth\nOut through the window let the neon sing\nIn place of telegraphs that don't mean a thing\nAnd we crawled off to our destinations\nRolling past the grey estates\n\nRushing through\nA new world\nA new world\nA new world\nIt's just a minute away\n\nRushing through\nA new world\nA new world\nA new world\nIt's just a minute away\n\nSo let the needle on the compass swing\nLet the iron in your heart's blood ring\nStrike up the band as the ship goes down\nAnd if it's loud enough\nThey will erase the sound\nOf one hundred thousand\nSad inventions\nLet them rot\nInside the grey estate\n\nRushing through\nA new world, a new world, a new world\nIt's just a minute away\nRushing through\nA new world, a new world, a new world\nIt's just a minute away\n\nI'm half awake and the world is ending\nAll across the border just a minute away\nI'm half awake and the world is ending\nAcross the border just a minute, just a minute away","url":"https://genius.com/Wolf-parade-the-grey-estates-lyrics"}
