{"title":"Goals In Slow Motion by Future of the Left","lyrics":"Dan, Dan, you're a good man\nBut you better not speak for me\nI spent sixteen hours in a luggage rack\nWith these children at my feet\nThey thought I was Brazilian\nThey made me sign their boots\nA special talent trapped inside\nThe body of a youth\n\nThe favelas of Nottingham are more\nMore than just a weekend in the sun\nIn the end he moved to Hull\nFirst on loan and then on glue\n\nChris, this shouldn't change you\nYou'd be better off kept indoors\nCos as racist strikers go, my friend\nYou're the best this club has sold\nAnd I have to say that woman\nWas hardly innocent\nAccepting drinks from animals\nIn lieu of paying rent\n\nThe favelas of Nottingham are more\nMore than just a weekend in the sun\nIn the end he moved to Hull\nFirst on loan and then on glue\n\nMore than just a weekend in the sun\nThe shanty towns of Derby are more than an hour in a life\nMore than just a weekend in the sun\nThe rolling plains of Swindon are more than a line in a song","url":"https://genius.com/Future-of-the-left-goals-in-slow-motion-lyrics"}
