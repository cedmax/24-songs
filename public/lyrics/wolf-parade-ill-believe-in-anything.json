{"title":"I'll Believe in Anything by Wolf Parade","lyrics":"Give me your eyes\nI need sunshine\nGive me your eyes\nI need sunshine\nYour blood\nYour bones\nYour voice\nAnd your ghost\n\nWe've both been very brave\nWalk around with both legs\nFight the scary day\nWe both pull the tricks out of our sleeves\n\nBut I'll believe in anything\nAnd you'll believe in anything\nI said I'll believe in anything\nAnd you'll believe in anything\n\nIf I could get the fire out from the wire\nI'd share a life and you'd share a life\nIf I could take the fire out from the wire\nI'd share a life and you'd share a life\nIf I could take the fire out from the water\nI'd take you where nobody knows you\nAnd nobody gives a damn\nI said nobody knows you\nAnd nobody gives a damn\n\nAnd I could take another hit for you\nAnd I could take away your trips from you\nAnd I could take away the salt from your eyes\nAnd take away what's been assaulting you\nAnd I could give you my apologies\nBy handing over my neologies\nAnd I could take away the shaking knees\nAnd I could give you all the olive trees\nOh look at the trees and look at my face\nAnd look at a place far away from here\n\nSo give me your eyes\nI need sunshine\nGive me your eyes\nI need sunshine\nYour blood\nYour bones\nYour voice\nAnd your ghost\n\nWe've both been very brave\nWalk around with both legs\nFight the scary day\nWe both pull the tricks out of our sleeves\nBut I'll believe in anything\nAnd you'll believe in anything\n\nIf I could take the fire out from the wire\nI'd share a life and you'd share a life\nIf I could take the fire out from the wire\nI'd share a life and you'd share a life\nIf I could take the fire out from the wire\nI'd take you where nobody knows you\nAnd nobody gives a damn\nI said nobody knows you\nAnd nobody gives a damn\n\nI said nobody knows you\nAnd nobody gives a damn either way\nAbout your blood\nYour bones\nYour voice\nAnd your ghost\nBecause nobody knows you\nAnd nobody gives a damn either way\nAnd now I'll believe in anything and you'll believe in anything\nBecause nobody knows you\nAnd nobody gives a damn either way","url":"https://genius.com/Wolf-parade-ill-believe-in-anything-lyrics"}
