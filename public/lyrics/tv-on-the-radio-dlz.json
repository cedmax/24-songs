{"title":"DLZ by TV on the Radio","lyrics":"Congratulations on the mess you made of things\nI'm trying to reconstruct the air and all that brings\nAnd oxidation is the compromise you own\nBut this is beginning to feel like the dog wants her bones, say\n\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la\n\nYou force your fire and then you falsify your deeds\nYour methods dot the disconnect from all your creeds\nAnd fortune strives to fill the vacuum that it feeds\nBut this is beginning to feel like the dog's lost her lead, say\n\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la\n\nThis is beginning to feel\nLike the long winded blues of the never\nThis is beginning to feel\nLike it's curling up slowly and finding a throat to choke\n\nThis is beginning to feel\nLike the long winded blues of the never\nBarely controlled locomotive consuming the picture\nAnd blowing the crows to smoke\n\nThis is beginning to feel\nLike the long winded blues of the never\nStatic explosion devoted to crushing the broken\nAnd shoving their souls to ghost\n\nEternalised, objectified\nYou set your sights so high\nBut this is beginning to feel\nLike the bolt busted loose from the lever\n\nNever mind, death professor\nYour structure's fine, my dust is better\nYour victim flies so high\nAll to catch a bird's eye view of who's next\n\nNever you mind, death professor\nLove is life, my love is better\nYour victim flies so high\nEyes could be the diamonds confused with who's next\n\nNever you mind, death professor\nYour shocks are fine, my struts are better\nYour fiction flies so high\nY'all could use a doctor who's sick, who's next?\n\nNever you mind, death professor\nElectrified, my love is better\nIt's crystallized, so am I\nAll could be the diamond fused with who's next\n\nThis is beginning to feel\nLike the dawn of the loser forever\nThis is beginning to feel\nLike the dawn of the loser forever\nThis is beginning to feel\nLike the dawn of the loser forever\nThis is beginning to feel\nLike the dawn of the loser forever","url":"https://genius.com/Tv-on-the-radio-dlz-lyrics"}
