{"title":"Swing Tree byÂ Discovery","lyrics":"[Chorus]\nIf I was a boy at sea\nI would be swinging from a broken tree\nI would be down on my back looking up at stars at night\nAnd if I could get back to reach, to reach the saltiest of evergreens\nYou know that I would turn back just to fight the whites of iron eyes\n\n[Verse 1: Rostam & Wes]\nWhen I hear that wind and I think of Spring\nUnderneath an open window, a carved out sign and\nOften I would fight with my mind\nSaltwater brine where you hung your crown\nWhen you washed your eyes in last night's tea\nI thought you might come out from the dream to find that\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I was a boy at sea\nI would be swinging from a broken tree\nI would be down on my back looking up at stars at night\nAnd if I could get back to reach, to reach the saltiest of evergreens (If I was a boy, if I was a boy)\nYou know that I would turn back just to fight the whites of iron eyes (If I was a boy)\n\n[Verse 2: Rostam & Wes]\nUnderneath the pine grew a patch of thyme\nThat I burned for six days in the sun\n'Til I heard the distant sound of drums\nOh, the queen had come and the King had died\nAnd my forehead burned but I closed my eyes\nAnd my forehead burned but I closed my, closed my eyes\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I was a boy at sea\nI would be swinging from a broken tree\nI would be down on my back looking up at stars at night\n(Before I go I've got to run down the street to the market cove) And if I could get back to reach, to reach the saltiest of evergreens\nYou know that I would turn back just to fight the whites of iron eyes (Where I could find six seeds to bring back to the yard and plant underneath the birch tree)\nIf I was a boy at sea (No white skies or red sunlight)\nI would be swinging from a broken tree (In the saltwater brine)\nI would be down on my back looking up at stars at night (My forehead burned but I closed my eyes)\n(Whoa, now you've got to go) And if I could get back to reach, to reach the saltiest of evergreens\nYou know that I would turn back just to fight the whites of iron eyes\n\n[Outro]\nIf I was a boy, if I was a boy\nIf I was a-\nIf I was a-\nIf I was a-\nIf I was a boy at-\nIf I was a-\nIf I was a boy at sea\nI would be swinging from a broken tree\nI would be down on my back looking up at stars at night","url":"https://genius.com/Discovery-swing-tree-lyrics"}
