{"title":"L.E.S. Artistes byÂ Santigold","lyrics":"What I'm searching for\nTo tell it straight, I'm trying to build a wall\nWalking by myself\nDown avenues that reek of time to kill\nIf you see me keep going\nBe a pass by waver\nBuild me up, bring me down\nJust leave me out you name dropper\nStop trying to catch my eye\nI see you good you forced faker\nJust make it easy\nYou're my enemy you fast talker\n\nI can say I hope it will be worth what I give up\nIf I could stand up mean for the things that I believe\nWhat am I here for\nI left my home to disappear is all\nI'm here for myself\nNot to know you\nI don't need no one else\nFit in so good the hope is that you cannot see me later\nYou don't know me\nI am an introvert an excavator\nI'm duckin' out for now\nA face in dodgy elevators\nCreep up and suddenly\nI found myself\nAn innovator\n\nChange, change, change\nI want to get up out of my skin\nTell you what\nIf I can shake it\nI'm 'a make this\nSomething worth dreaming of","url":"https://genius.com/Santigold-les-artistes-lyrics"}
