{"title":"Laid by The Pains of Being Pure at Heart","lyrics":"This bed is on fire with passionate love\nThe neighbours complain about the noises above\nBut she only comes when she’s on top\n\nMy therapist says not to see you no more\nShe said you’re like a disease without any cure\nShe said I’m so obsessed that I’m becoming a bore, oh no\n\nGod, you think you’re so pretty\n\nHey\n\nCaught your hand inside the till\nSlammed your fingers in the door\nFought with kitchen knives and skewers\nDressed me up in women’s clothes\nMessed around with gender roles\nLine my eyes and call me pretty\n\nHey\n\nI moved out of the house\nSo you move next door\nI locked you out\nYou cut a hole in the wall\nI caught you sleeping next to me\nI thought I was alone\nYou’re driving me crazy\nWhen are you coming home?\n\nAh, you think you’re so pretty\n\nHey","url":"https://genius.com/The-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart-laid-lyrics"}
