{"title":"How It Should Be (Sha Sha) by Ben Kweller","lyrics":"When I was a movie star\nAn asteroid had hit the Earth\nAnd prematurely ended my career\nI thought out loud, but no one heard me saying:\n\nNothing isn't nothing\nNothing's something that's important to me\nThat's right\nAnd everyone's a little nothing\nThat is how it should be\n\nThat's right. That's right\nSha sha. Sha doo\n\nWhen I was an astronaut\nI bought a fancy charm\nI thought you liked it but you called it cheap\nAnd at my feet, it fell, like:\n\nSo sue me\nIt's up to me if I decide to be what I think is right\nAnd don't bother me when I'm watching 'Planet of the Apes' on T.V\n\nThat's right. That's how it should be\nSha sha. Sha doo\n\nSo sue me\nIt's up to me if I decide to be what I think is right\nThe sound, it found, the ground, and it hid it for free\n\nThat's right. That's how it should be\nSha sha. Sha doo","url":"https://genius.com/Ben-kweller-how-it-should-be-sha-sha-lyrics"}
