{"songs":"Really? by Prince Daddy & The Hyena","lyrics":"I think I'm getting depressed again\nI think I'm gonna lose all my friends\nI'm trying to switch up my medicine\nSo I can be more of a gentleman\nIt's just the more I sleep, the less I eat\nAnd everything would matter just a little bit less\nIf I saved a couple pounds and I just lost the rest\nI guess I got too caught up in confidence to feel confident\n\nI think I'm having a panic attack\nI think I'm disappointing my dad\nJust stuff me into a duffle bag\nSo I can feel all alone again\nWhenever I fall asleep\nI keep on having the same damn dreams\nI know you heard this already\nBut I don't ever want you to leave\nI thought you didn't even like to leave\n\nAnd I know you can surf this too","url":"https://genius.com/Prince-daddy-and-the-hyena-really-lyrics"}
