{"title":"Oxford Comma by Vampire Weekend","lyrics":"Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?\nI've seen those English dramas too; they're cruel\nSo if there's any other way to spell the word\nIt's fine with me, with me\n\nWhy would you speak to me that way?\nEspecially when I always said that I\nHaven't got the words for you\nAll your diction dripping with disdain\nThrough the pain, I always tell the truth\n\nWho gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?\nI climbed to Dharamsala too, I did\nI met the highest Lama\nHis accent sounded fine to me, to me\n\nTake your handbook, it's no trick\nTake the chapstick, put it on your lips\nCrack a smile, adjust my tie\nKnow your boyfriend, unlike other guys\n\nWhy would you lie 'bout how much coal you have?\nWhy would you lie about something dumb like that?\nWhy would you lie 'bout anything at all?\nFirst the window, then it's to the wall\nLil Jon, he always tells the truth\n\nCheck your passport, it's no trick\nTake the chapstick, put it on your lips\nCrack a smile, adjust my tie\nKnow your butler, unlike other guys\n\nWhy would you lie 'bout how much coal you have?\nWhy would you lie about something dumb like that?\nWhy would you lie 'bout anything at all?\nFirst the window, then it's through the wall\nWhy would you tape my conversations?\nShow your paintings at the United Nations\nLil Jon, he always tells the truth","url":"https://genius.com/Vampire-weekend-oxford-comma-lyrics"}
