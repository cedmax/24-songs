{"title":"Pontiac 87 by Preoccupations","lyrics":"I recall seeing the pope\nPontiac 1987\nMoney changing between hands\nOutside the Silverdome\nAfterwards a riot broke\nOld folks turned brutish\nTrampling their way out the gates\nTowards heaven\n\nThat fall from grace\nKnocked me on my knees\nDon’t tell anyone\nThat's what I wanted\nThe god of change\nKnocked me on my knees\nDon’t tell anyone\nThat's what I wanted\n\nRemembering a Jumbo’s night\nDecember 26th\nWeird faces filled up the bar\nHalf sober\nOutside a steady snow\nAll new white\nWith new money and false friends\nI don’t like it\n\nThat fall from grace\nKnocked me on my knees\nDon’t tell anyone\nThat's what I wanted\nThe god of change\nKnocked me on my knees\nDon’t tell anyone\nThat's what I wanted\n\nThe dog in the manger\nEats its anger\nBut I miss it\nThe way it was\nBefore the scales\nFell from my eyes\n\nThere's no use being sad about it\nWhat's the point of crying about it","url":"https://genius.com/Preoccupations-pontiac-87-lyrics"}
