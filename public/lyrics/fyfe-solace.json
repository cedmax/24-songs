{"title":"Solace byÂ Fyfe","lyrics":"[Chorus]\nLiving isn't easy, when you've been free and it's taken away\nI will lay my head down, until some sense has been found\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm hardly known in this neighbourhood\nBut I can't help feeling like I've been misunderstood\nRight to my bones, yes my sinew shook\nI feel this ground is breaking, nothing is there underfoot\n\n[Chorus]\nLiving isn't easy, when you've been free and it's taken away\nI will lay my head down, until some sense has been found\n\n[Verse 2]\nDays on days, looking back I lay\nI know I'm insecure but I've been wasting away\nSolace comes like I hoped it would\nLove has overcome things I didn't know that it could\n\n[Chorus]\nLiving isn't easy, when you've been free and it's taken away\nI will lay my head down, until some sense has been found","url":"https://genius.com/Fyfe-solace-lyrics"}
