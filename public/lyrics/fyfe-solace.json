{"title":"Solace byÂ Fyfe","lyrics":"Living isn't easy, when you've been free and it's taken away\nI will lay my head down, until some sense has been found\n\nI'm hardly known in this neighbourhood\nBut I can't help feeling like I've been misunderstood\nRight to my bones, yes my sinew shook\nI feel this ground is breaking, nothing is there underfoot\n\nLiving isn't easy, when you've been free and it's taken away\nI will lay my head down, until some sense has been found\n\nDays on days, looking back I lay\nI know I'm insecure but I've been wasting away\nSolace comes like I hoped it would\nLove has overcome things I didn't know that it could\n\nLiving isn't easy, when you've been free and it's taken away\nI will lay my head down, until some sense has been found","url":"https://genius.com/Fyfe-solace-lyrics"}
