{"title":"That Look You Give that Guy byÂ Eels","lyrics":"I never thought that I could be so bold\nTo even say these thoughts aloud\nI see you with your man\nYour eyes just shine\nWhile he stands tall\nAnd walking proud\n\n[Chorus 1]\nThat look you give that guy\nI wanna see\nLooking right at me\nIf I could be that guy\nInstead of me\nI'd never let you down\n\nIt always seems like you're going somewhere\nBetter than you've been before\nWhile I go to sleep and I dream all night\nOf you knocking at my door\n\n[Chorus 2]\nThat look you give that guy\nI wanna see\nLooking right at me\nIf I could be that guy\nInstead of me\nI'd be all I can be\n\nI'm nothing like what I'd like to be\nI'm nothing much I know it's true\nI lack the style and the pedigree\nAnd my chances are so few\n\n[Chorus 3]\nThat look you give that guy\nI wanna see\nLooking right at me\nIf I could be that guy\nInstead of me\nI'd give you all I got\n\nI never thought that I could be so bold\nTo even say these thoughts aloud\nBut it, let's say, it won't work out\nYou know where I can be found\n\n[Chorus 1]","url":"https://genius.com/Eels-that-look-you-give-that-guy-lyrics"}
