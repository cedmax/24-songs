    "lyrics": "How I wish you could see the potential\nThe potential of you and me\nIt's like a book elegantly bound, but\nIn a language that you can't read just yet\n\nYou gotta spend some time, love\nYou gotta spend some time with me\nAnd I know that you'll find, love\nI will possess your heart\nYou gotta spend some time, love\nYou gotta spend some time with me\nAnd I know that you'll find, love\nI will possess your heart\n\nThere are days when, outside your window\nI see my reflection as I slowly pass\nAnd I long for this mirrored perspective\nWhen we'll be lovers, lovers at last\n\nYou gotta spend some time, love\nYou gotta spend some time with me\nAnd I know that you'll find, love\nI will possess your heart\nYou gotta spend some time, love\nYou gotta spend some time with me\nAnd I know that you'll find, love\nI will possess your heart\nI will possess your heart\nI will possess your heart\n\nYou reject my advances\nAnd desperate pleas\nI won't let you let me down\nSo easily\nSo easily\n\nYou gotta spend some time, love\nYou gotta spend some time with me\nAnd I know that you'll find, love\nI will possess your heart\nYou gotta spend some time, love\nYou gotta spend some time with me\nAnd I know that you'll find, love\nI will possess your heart\nYou gotta spend some time, love\nYou gotta spend some time with me\nAnd I know that you'll find, love\nI will possess your heart\n\nI will possess your heart\nI will possess your heart",
