{"songs":"Shine a Light by Wolf Parade","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nI keep my head up tight, I make my plans at night\nAnd I don't sleep, I don't sleep, I don't sleep 'til it's light\nSome folks float, some are buried alive\n\nThere is an awful sound, this haunted town\nIt will not, it will not, it will not just be quiet\nSome ghosts sink, some will get called to the light\n\n[Verse 2]\nI spend boring hours in the office tower\nIn a bus, on a bus back home to you\nAnd that's fine I'm barely alive\n\nIt's just a matter of time, no one gets out alive\nAnd I'm content, I'm content, I'm content to be quiet\nSome will sink, some will get called to the light\n\n[Chorus] x2\nYou know our hearts beat time out very slowly\nYou know our hearts beat time\nThey're waiting for something that'll never arrive\n\n[Verse 3]\nI keep my head up tight, I make my plans at night\nAnd I don't sleep, I don't sleep, I don't sleep 'til it's light\nSome folks float, some are buried alive\n\nWith our little boots, we built another world\nWhere we're chain, chain, chain, chain, chained to the light\nThat's fine, our blood is alive\n\n[Chorus]\nYou know our hearts beat time out very slowly\nYou know our hearts beat time\nThey're waiting for something that'll never arrive","url":"https://genius.com/Wolf-parade-shine-a-light-lyrics"}
