{"title":"Rubber Traits byÂ WHY?","lyrics":"I want to always be on film\nTo be caught in the cut, coffee sober\nDing-di-ding-di-ding-ding boom boom boulder\nUnscratched lenses, of a brand new prescription\nDrawing days from a stacked deck of cards and doing... doing\nI should cut down my caloric intake\nI should go to sleep hungry and wake up with my guts knotted up\nAnd ears open like a burnt down hut\n\nI want my mouth to always taste the blade\nBut I want, but I want, but ohhhhhh\nI want to kiss like taffy\nHump gentle on a bed of nails and\nFeel salt to widen eyes like a cut up clam's tongue does\nI want to dump early on and be empty the rest\nI want a patch of blue sky to follow me\n\nUnfold an origami death mask\nAnd cut my DNA with rubber traits\nPull apart the double helix like a wishbone\nAlways be working on a suicide note\n\nI don't want to\nWhen I feel like I could've gone long\nI don't want to\nWhen I feel like I could've gone longer\nI don't want to\nWhen I feel like I could've gone longer\nI don't want to\nWhen I feel like I could've gone\n\nProductive, fully charged, cocked, and pointed\nKeep a tape recorder on my bedside table\nSweats, only the pants that fit the best, no belts, no cuffs\nWalked home yet loose keep heel dies blue to a ten\nWatch a fly hit a pane of glass till it gets real bony\nHis stomach swells up and he dies\n\nI don't want to\nWhen I feel like I could've gone long\nI don't want to\nWhen I feel like I could've gone longer\nI don't want to\nWhen I feel like I could've gone longer\nI don't want to\nWhen I feel like I could've gone","url":"https://genius.com/Why-rubber-traits-lyrics"}
