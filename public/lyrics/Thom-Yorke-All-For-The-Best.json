{"title":"All For The Best by Thom Yorke (Ft. Andy Yorke)","lyrics":"Waking up and the bed was made\nNo one looked me in the eye\nThe more I try, the more I cry\nAnd it's all for the best\n\nWatch my brother\nCutting grass outside\nSitting on the porch he told me\n\"It's a long way to go\nBefore we can rest\nAnd it's all for the best.\"\n\nYou're so beautiful it seems\nOn a lonely, lazy morning\nAnd when I see you rocking back and forth\nWhispering that it's all for the best\n\nOne day the stone will roll away\nAnd soon you'll see\nYou're far away from home but never far away from me\nAnd that's all for the best\n\nPromise me son not to do the things I've done\nAnd walk away from trouble\n\nSay you love me\nSay you love me\nSay you love me\nLet's just say you love me","url":"https://genius.com/Thom-yorke-all-for-the-best-lyrics"}
