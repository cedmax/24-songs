{"songs":"Modern World by Wolf Parade","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nI'm not in love with the modern world\nI'm not in love with the modern world\nIt was a torch driving the savages back to the trees\nModern world has modern ways\nAnd I don't mention it since it's changed\nWhile the people go out and the people come home again\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's gotta last to build up your eyes\nAnd a lifetime of red skies\nAnd from my bed, saying you're haunted, hissing in my bed\nModern world don't ask why\nCause modern world will build things high\nNow they house canyons filled with life\n\n[Refrain]\nModern world, I'm not pleased to meet you\nYou just bring me down\nModern world, I'm not pleased to meet you\nYou just bring me down\nModern world, I'm not pleased to meet you\nYou just bring me down\nModern world, I'm not pleased to meet you\nYou just bring me down\nModern world, I'm not pleased to meet you\nYou just bring me down","url":"https://genius.com/Wolf-parade-modern-world-lyrics"}
