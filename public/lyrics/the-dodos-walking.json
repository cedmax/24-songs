    "lyrics": "You can fight the fire that's in your head\nLay it down, the hour has come to end\nWalk around without her just for a bit\nLooking back upon the way things had been\n\nMan, I've been wasting so much time\nWalking the same street every night\nDon't you think maybe it's about time?\n\nYou can light the fire that's in your head\nPut it off, tomorrow will come instead\nWe don't watch the tower that tells us when\nPull the wicked flower out from its bed\n\nMan's been wasting so much time\nSending the children out to fight\nDon't you think maybe it's about time?",
