{"songs":"Lewis Takes Off His Shirt by Owen Pallett","lyrics":"As soon as I got on the horse I forgot about the math\nForgot about the odds against an adolescent standing up to all of Owen's wrath\nThe heat of prairie summer is impossible to take\nI grab the hem and lift the fabric over my sweet head\nI know what you're looking for and I'm never gonna give it to you\nI'm never gonna give it to you\nI'm never gonna give it to you\n\nGovernment rule established by a dazzling light show\nA hegemony armored with a thousand-watt head and seven inches of echo\nI keep up my velocity my spurs are in her sides\nI don't know what I'm doing and it is the only way\nToward the range I'll ride, singing, I'm never gonna give it to you\nI'm never gonna give it to you\nI'm never gonna give it to you\n\n\"I am overrated\" said the sculptress to the sea\n\"I've been praised for all the ways the marble leaves the man\nAnd I was wrong to try and free him\"\nAnd as for me I am a vector I am muscle I am bone\nThe sun upon my shoulders and the horse between my legs\nThis is all I know\n\nMy senses are bedazzled by the parallax of the road\nI concentrate to keep contained the overflow\nMy knuckles grip so tightly my fingers start to bleed\nIf what I have is what you need\nI'm never gonna give it to you\nI'm never gonna give it to you\nI'm never gonna give it to you","url":"https://genius.com/Owen-pallett-lewis-takes-off-his-shirt-lyrics"}
