{"title":"Modern Art by Black Lips","lyrics":"K-Hole at the Dalí\nSeeing the unknown\nWell I might have been on molly\nBecause my mind's being blown\nTake the escalator to the next floor\nSuch a strong sedater, now I can't find the door\n\nYou turn around\nAnd you don't know where you been\nAnd you look up at the glass dome\nAnd the room begins to spin\nLet's go out and find the ocean\nCause I think we need a swim\nTurn around, start it over, let's begin\n\nLike the Minis at the Louvre\nSpinning down the aisles\nAnd the paintings start to move, got me feelin' really smart\nLike a 3D picture, stereoscope\nIt's a total light picture, kaleidoscope\n\nYou turn around\nAnd you don't know where you been\nAnd you look up at the glass dome\nAnd the room begins to spin\nLet's go out and find the ocean\nCause I think we need a swim\nTurn around, start it over, let's begin\n\nAt the K-Hole at the Dali\nSeeing the unknown\nWell I might have been on molly\nBecause my mind's being blown\n\nYou turn around\nAnd you don't know where you been\nAnd you look up at the glass dome\nAnd the room begins to spin\nLet's go out and find the ocean\nCause I think we need a swim\nTurn around, start it over, let's begin","url":"https://genius.com/Black-lips-modern-art-lyrics"}
