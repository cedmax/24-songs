{"title":"Wet and Rusting byÂ Menomena","lyrics":"I made you a present, you'll never expect it\nAnd when you unravel, the secret will travel\n\nIt's hard to take risks with a pessimist\n\nI hope that this shaking will help us awaken\nSeparated by skin 'til we let ourselves in\n\nIt's hard to take risks, with a pessimist\nIt's hard to take risks\n\nI hope one will burn me, I know you'll desert me\n(This is the closest I'll come to touching you the way I want)\n\nThe hope can be painful, I'll try to be faithful\n(It's hard to take risks, with a pessimist)\n\nThe hope can be painful, I'll try to be faithful\n(It's hard to take risks, with a pessimist)\n\nThe hope can be painful, I'll try to be faithful\n(It's hard to take risks, you're a pessimist)\n(This is the closest I'll come to touching you)","url":"https://genius.com/Menomena-wet-and-rusting-lyrics"}
