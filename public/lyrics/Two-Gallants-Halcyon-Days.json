{"songs":"Halcyon Days by Two Gallants","lyrics":"When jealousy raps on the door\n\"Well, what have you come here for?\"\nTo whisper your dreams away\n\nThey say you've loved too hard\nEnough to enrage the gods\nAnd now there's hell to pay\n\nAnd with your name upon my lips\nI sunk down\nAnd relived your farewell kiss\nAs I drowned\n\nSo I went off in search of advice\nThough you warned me to think twice\n\"I see death on the sea my love\"\n\nI said \"I'll return 'fore long\nAnd we'll live in the light of the dawn\"\nI heard faint laughter above\n\nAnd with your name upon my lips\nNo one's ever loved like this\nI sunk down\nAnd relived your farewell kiss\nAs I drowned\n\nRun and see run to the shore\nAnd at your feet on waves I'll roll\nStill asleep drenched to the core\nAnd we will love like gods once more","url":"https://genius.com/Two-gallants-halcyon-days-lyrics"}
