{"title":"Modern Girl (...With Scissors) by Alec Ounsworth","lyrics":"Oh, the light left the room\nDeborah, where did it go?\nShe said that she left home a Yankee with something to sell\nBut the seas got dry somehow\nThere's no such thing as grim weather out here\nYou don’t have to trust me\nI know as I set up my circus tent, one week later\nTo want to rip it down\n\nShe had the highest disease\nFor which there's never a cure\nAt least that's what she believes\n\nOh, the ambulance left her\nIn a heap next to a bar\nLike an ordinary citizen tied up in the trunk of a car\nOh, but she don’t moan none\nShe just gets taller\nAs the trees find their way down\nAnd the bottom's the top as I trade in my radio for something smaller\nSomething I can fit into my pulse\n\nOh, the highest disease\nFor which there's never a cure\nAt least that's what she believes\nAnd when the city gets rough\nShe gets into her balloon\nLeaving all the old stuff\nLeaving only with\nAll this useless beauty now\nAll this useless beauty\n\nOh, the light left the room\nDeborah, where did it go?\nShe said that she left home a Yankee with something to sell\nBut the seas got dry somehow\nThere's no such thing as grim weather out here\nYou don't have to trust me\nI know as I set up my circus tent, one week later\nTo want to rip it down\n\nAll this useless beauty now\nAll this useless beauty","url":"https://genius.com/Alec-ounsworth-modern-girl-with-scissors-lyrics"}
