{"title":"Popstar Researching Oblivion by Flotation Toy Warning","lyrics":"I never knew what you thought was here\nGet another fear to add to the list\nI've been collecting little lies\nJust to put on the special tape\nI get them to play the day you die\n\nI'll tell them you were always frightened\nJust like anybody else\nAnd you cried inside just like me\n\nYou seem to live with fingertips\nWrapped around your face\nDoes it keep the dark away?\nTalk to me and tell me that all of them are wrong\nAnd all my dreams will come in time\n\nTrying, trying to understand it all\nTo understand it all just makes your head hurt\nTrying, trying to understand it all\nTo understand it all just makes your head hurt\n\nYes you have all the pieces they said that you had to collect\nBut what did you expect that all to amount to?\n\nTrying, trying to understand it all\nTo understand it all just makes your head hurt\nTrying, trying to understand it all\nTo understand it all just makes your head hurt","url":"https://genius.com/Flotation-toy-warning-popstar-researching-oblivion-lyrics"}
