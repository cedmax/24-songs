    "lyrics": "And now we proudly present\nSongs perverse and songs of lament\nA couple hymns of confession\nAnd songs that recognize our sick obsessions\nSing along - I'm on the ugly organ, again\nSing along - I'm on the ugly organ, so let's begin\nThere's no use to keep a secret\nEverything I hide ends up in lyrics\nSo read on - accuse me when you're done\nIf it sounds like I did you wrong\n\nWhoa-oh\n\nOur Father, who art in heaven\nSave me from the wreck I'm about to drown in\nDidn't I learn anything\nCounting out my sins on rosary beads?\nThe reverend plays on the ugly organ, uh-huh\nHe spews out his sweet and salty sermon\nOn the audience\nSo why do I think I'm any different?\nI've been making money off my indifference\nWe all pass the hat around\n'This is my body', this is the blood I found\nOn my hands, after I wrote this album\nPlay it off as stigmata for crossover fans\nSome red-handed sleight of hand\n\nWhoa-oh\nWhoa, yeah\nWow\nWhoa, whoa-oh",
