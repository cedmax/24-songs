{"title":"Everybody That You Love by Bomb the Music Industry!","lyrics":"They're looking at me with their glassy eyes, they're gonna bury me\nDripping with Hennessy and ecstasy, they're gonna bury me\nI guess I probably should have done my research\nHey!\n\nAnd I know that it's darkest before dawn\n'Cause I've been staying up for way too long\nAnd I know that it only takes one call\nBut we've got no options\n\nSome people can fake it, but my arms are weak. My hands are shaky. No one's scared of me\nTrying to keep the kamikazes still they're gonna bury me\nI guess I should have watched where I was pissing instead of off the rocks\nOf an abandoned Greenpoint dock\nWe had such an awesome night and getting shanked would be a disappointment\n\nOh, I understand the calm before the storm because\nI like to hang out where it's warm\nAnd I know that it's darkest before dawn\nBut I see clearly. Oh, I get it now\n\nAll the people I love the best\nAre starting to get frustrated with me being a mess\nAnd the people I kinda hate are always depressed\nAll the people I love the best\nHave grown increasingly impatient with the person I am\nAnd some people I hardly know will never understand\n\nAnd I know that it's darkest before dawn\n'cause I've been staying up for way too long\nAnd even if I never get to call, I still loved you\nHope you loved me too\n\nThey're gonna bury me\nThey're gonna bury me\nThey're gonna bury me\nThey're gonna bury me","url":"https://genius.com/Bomb-the-music-industry-everybody-that-you-love-lyrics"}
