{"title":"The Modern Leper by Frightened Rabbit","lyrics":"A cripple walks amongst you\nAll you tired human beings\nHe's got all the things a cripple has not\nTwo working arms and legs\n\nAnd vital parts fall from his system\nAnd dissolve in Scottish rain\nBut vitally, he doesn't miss them\nHe's too fucked up to care\n\nWell is that you in front of me?\nComing back for even more of exactly the same\nYou must be a masochist\nTo love a modern leper on his last leg, on his last leg\n\nWell I crippled your heart a hundred times\nAnd still can't work out why\nYou see, I've got this disease\nI can't shake and I'm just rattling through life\n\nWell this is how we do things now\nYeah this is how the modern stay scared\nSo I cut out all the good stuff\nYeah I cut off my foot to spite my leg\n\nWell is that you in front of me?\nComing back for even more of exactly the same\nYou must be a masochist\nTo love a modern leper on his last leg\n\nWell I am ill but I'm not dead\nAnd I don't know which of those I prefer\nBecause that limb which I have lost\nWell it was the only thing holding me up, holding me up\n\nWell I'm lying on the ground now\nAnd you're walking through the only door\nWell I have lost my eyesight like I said I would\nBut I still know\n\nThat that is you in front of me\nAnd you are back for even more of exactly the same\nWell are you a masochist?\nYou love a modern leper on his last leg\n\nAnd you're not ill and I'm not dead\nDoesn't that make us the perfect pair?\nYou should sit with me and we'll start again\nAnd you can tell me all about what you did today\nWhat you did today","url":"https://genius.com/Frightened-rabbit-the-modern-leper-lyrics"}
