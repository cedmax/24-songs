{"title":"Barbary Coast (Later) by Conor Oberst","lyrics":"There's a dancehall there\nWhere the sick folks go\nLike the olden days on the Barbary Coast\nThere's a barefoot child playing in the rain\nYou can sell your wares even if they're hot\nIn the great bazaar or the parking lot\n'Cause it takes a while to know who to blame\nI might have a taste cause the first one's free\nAnd the checkout girl's got a thing for me\nAnd they're both as sweet as the day is long\n\nI don't wanna feel stuck, baby\nI just wanna get drunk before noon\n\nI don't mind my head when there's room to dream\nFeel like Paul Gauguin painting breadfruit trees\nIn some far off place where I don't belong\nTried to lose myself in the primitive\nIn Yosemite like John Muir did\nBut his eyes were blue and mine are red and raw\n'Cause the modern world is a sight to see\nIt's a stimulant, it's pornography\nIt takes all my will not to turn it off\n\nI don't want you to feel sad, baby\nI take everything back, I swear I do\n\n'Cause once all the friends I had\nHave used me up and left\nI bet you hang around\nI bet you'll hang around awhile","url":"https://genius.com/Conor-oberst-barbary-coast-later-lyrics"}
