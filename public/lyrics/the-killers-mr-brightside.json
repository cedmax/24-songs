    "lyrics": "Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine\nGotta gotta be down because I want it all\nIt started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?\nIt was only a kiss, it was only a kiss\nNow I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab\nWhile he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag\nNow they're going to bed and my stomach is sick\nAnd it's all in my head, but she's touching his\n\nChest now, he takes off her dress now\nLet me go\nI just can't look, it's killing me\nAnd taking control\n\nJealousy, turning saints into the sea\nSwimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis\nBut it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me\nOpen up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside\n\n[Instrumental]\n\nI'm coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine\nGotta gotta be down because I want it all\nIt started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?\n(It was only a kiss), it was only a kiss\nNow I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab\nWhile he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag\nNow they're going to bed and my stomach is sick\nAnd it's all in my head, but she's touching his\n\nChest now, he takes off her dress now\nLet me go\n'Cause I just can't look, it's killing me\nAnd taking control\n\nJealousy, turning saints into the sea\nSwimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis\nBut it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me\nOpen up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside\n\nI never\nI never\nI never\nI never",
