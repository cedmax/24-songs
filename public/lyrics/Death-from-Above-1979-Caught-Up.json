{"title":"Caught Up by Death From Above 1979","lyrics":"Tell me one thing you've lied about\nTake all our fears and drink them out\nAll the way out\nIt's not the same if we condone each other\nSwapping out the cheese for something similar\nThe bait and switch of love and logic\nTake my life, please, I forgot it\nRing the bell and you'll get hard\n\nI'd come around when I hear that sound\nI'll come around\n\nI'm not caught up like all the other guys\nBut I'm still caught up on something\nI'm not caught up like all the other guys\nBut I'm still caught up on something\nYou, you\n\nTell me one thing you care about\nTake your beliefs and shake them out\nAll the way out\nThe gates are open there's no hope\nIn shutting out the world\nAnd fighting over small differences\nThe world and all its discontents\nCan't see the beauty in the present\nPass the lucy on the left\n\nI'd come around when I hear that sound\nI'll come around\n\nShe's a stopper, keep it double\nA double love around and make me humble\nI remember, I remember\nI tied a string around my finger to forget her\nEcho, echo, give me a sound\nSomething to remember when I'm in the ground\nMirror, mirror, please don't break\nI couldn't take the bad luck\nIf I never see her face again, again, again\n\nI'm not caught up like all the other guys\nBut I'm still caught up on something\nI'm not caught up like all the other guys\nBut I'm still caught up on something\nYou, you\nI'm caught up on you\nI'm caught up on you","url":"https://genius.com/Death-from-above-1979-caught-up-lyrics"}
