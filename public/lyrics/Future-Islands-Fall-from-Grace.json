{"songs":"Fall from Grace by Future Islands","lyrics":"You were mine when I was young\nWhy does it take so long?\nWhen you were here, it was warm\nNow it's just a bitter storm\n\nNow I'm older, turning white\nWatching days turn into nights\nNow I'm older and I'm grave\nTell me, what's been left to save?\n\nPardon my reflection\nIn the mirror, at your feet\nBefore you go, please tell me\n\"Was it all inside of me?\"\n\nI'll leave here in the morning\nI'll leave here in the morning\nI'll leave here in the morning\n\nYou were mine when I was young\nWhy does it take so long?\nNow I'm older and I'm grave\nTell me, \"what's been left to save?\"\n\nI held you in the morning\nIn the doorway of the sea\n\"Pardon my reflection\nIt was all inside of me.\"\n\nWe slowly fall from grace\nWe slowly fall from grace\nWe slowly fall from grace\nWe slowly fade away\nWe slowly fade away\nWe slowly fade away\nWe slowly fade away\nWe slowly fade away","url":"https://genius.com/Future-islands-fall-from-grace-lyrics"}
