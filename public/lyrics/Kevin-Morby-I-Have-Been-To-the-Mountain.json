{"songs":"I Have Been to the Mountain by Kevin Morby","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nCalling out\nDemanding answers\nPleading skies\nCry for hours\nDropping peace bombs\nCollecting prayers\nA sky that mirrors\nA sky that stares as I sing\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI have been to the mountain\nAnd I have walked on his shore\nI have seen but I can't see him no more\n\n[Verse 2]\nRound 'em out, make an echo\nDestroy the destroyer\nAnd do it fast\nThat man lived in this town\nTil that pig took him down\nAnd have you heard the sound\nOf a man stop breathing, pleading?\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI have been to the valley\nAnd I have sung all her songs\nWatch me sing\nWatch me sing along\nAnd I say\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI have been to the mountain\nAnd I have walked on his shore\nI have seen but I can't see him no more","url":"https://genius.com/Kevin-morby-i-have-been-to-the-mountain-lyrics"}
