{"title":"Your Haircut Man by Warm Thoughts","lyrics":"I'll still give you haircuts if you let me\nWe can forget we ever tried anything\nI'll sweep your hair up off the floor\nKeep it in a zip-lock bag\nAnd keep it in my top drawer\n\nI'm just your haircut man now\nSo please come and sit down\nLet me touch your hair\nIn a perfectly, pleasantly, harmless, platonic way\nIn a perfectly, pleasantly, harmless, platonic way\nIn a perfectly, pleasantly, harmless, platonic way\nIn a perfectly, pleasantly, harmless, platonic way\n\nBut I have to lay here on our couch\nAnd listen to you fuck every night\nI want to move out\nI want to move on\n\nIt's not me you're sharing your room with anymore\nI want to move out\nI want to move on\n\nI have to lay here on our couch\nAnd listen to you fuck every night\nI want to move out\nI want to move on\n\nIt's not me you're trying new things with behind closed doors\nI want to move out\nI want to move on","url":"https://genius.com/Warm-thoughts-your-haircut-man-lyrics"}
