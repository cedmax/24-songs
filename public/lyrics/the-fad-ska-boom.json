{"title":"Ska-Boom! by The Fad","lyrics":"I was there wearing Hawaiian shirts in December\nCarson Daly's posing as a RBF member\nJust so happy getting thrown in the trash\nWho'd have known that six years later\nI'd be sitting on my ass\nLight the fuse again\nSka-Boom & Everybody changes their attitude\nSka-Boom & Everybody wanna be a rude boy\nSka-Boom & Everybody changes their attitude\nWhen it's not so cool anymore\nTheir gonna turn their backs you know it's true\nI'm aware of where the chips have fallen\nIs bringing it back my true calling?\nJust so happy getting stoned & getting trashed\nAnd I know that six years later\nI'll be sitting on my ass","url":"https://genius.com/The-fad-ska-boom-lyrics"}
