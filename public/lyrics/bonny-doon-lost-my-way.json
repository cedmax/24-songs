{"title":"Lost My Way by Bonny Doon","lyrics":"Where, where do I belong\nWhat, what should I believe\nWho oh who've I become\nDo I, do I, do I even recognize me\n\nAnd I think somewhere along the line\nI lost my way\n\nI saw your dreaming eyes one morning when the sun came up just right\nAnd I just want to feel all right\nDoesn't matter how you get there\nDoesn't matter how you get there\n\nI think somewhere along the line\nI lost my way\nI think somewhere along the line\nI lost my way","url":"https://genius.com/Bonny-doon-lost-my-way-lyrics"}
