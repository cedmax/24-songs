{"title":"Big Mouth by Petrol Girls","lyrics":"Voices of the marginalized\nTolerated if we remain quiet\nBodies of the marginalized\nTolerated under their control\nVoices of the marginalized\nTolerated if we remain quiet\nBodies of the marginalized\nTolerated!\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm raising my voice louder\nIt carries me beyond their walls\nOur silence will not save us\nThey can't contain, they can't control\nThey can't control\n\nSome people think little girls should be seen and not heard\nBut I think\nUp yours\nOne, two, three, four\n\nKeep your voice down\nKnow your place\nBite your tongue\nYou best behave\nKeep your head down\nStay in line\nKeep your mouth shut\nWith a lovely smile\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm raising my voice louder\nIt carries me beyond their walls\nOur silence will not save us\nThey can't contain, they can't control\n\nI'm raising my voice louder\nIt carries me beyond their walls\nOur silence will not save us\nThey can't contain, they can't control\nThey can't contain, they can't control\n\nI think it happens to different groups in different ways\nAnd I can only speak about my experience as a woman\nBut the point that I think so many of us have in common is this demand on us to be quiet and polite and nice\nLike you're meant to just smile through it and fucking get on with it\nLike when you say no or fight back or even just disagree, you're the one that's the fucking problem\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm raising my voice louder\nIt carries me beyond their walls\nOur silence will not save us\nThey can't contain, they can't control\n\nI'm raising my voice louder\nIt carries me beyond their walls\nOur silence will not save us\nThey can't contain, they can't control\nThey can't contain, they can't control\n\nI cannot remain crescent\nA chewed finger nail spat into the darkness\nA sliver of light\nIn someone else's depiction of night\nI am looming\nMonstrous","url":"https://genius.com/Petrol-girls-big-mouth-lyrics"}
