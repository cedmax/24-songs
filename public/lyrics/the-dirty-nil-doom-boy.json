{"title":"Doom Boy by The Dirty Nil","lyrics":"I know you try to stay happy\nBut the winds of doubt are blowing heavy\nTell me, girl, do you like\nThe Cro-Mags and Turnstile?\n\nIf you do, I'm begging you\nCome with me, let me be\n\nYour doom boy\nWe could hold hands\nListen to Slayer\nIn the back of my Dodge Caravan\n\nDo you delight in rule breaking?\nDancing to thrash and hailing Satan\nOkay, alright\nLet's rage tonight\n\nCrank the dial and stay a while\nThen you'll see, I could be\n\nYour doom boy\nWe could hold hands\nListen to Slayer\nIn the back of my Dodge Caravan\n\nIt's my mom's Dodge Caravan\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\nDoom boy\nWe could hold hands\nListen to Slayer\nIn the back of my Dodge Caravan\n\nYeah!\n\nLet me be your doom boy, baby","url":"https://genius.com/The-dirty-nil-doom-boy-lyrics"}
