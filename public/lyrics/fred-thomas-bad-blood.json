{"title":"Bad Blood by Fred Thomas","lyrics":"Bad blood saturating the sheets and the blankets\nGood god, there are ghosts floating up from the pavement\nThey flip over the houses, blood runs out from the basements\nIn it’s unholy flow\nYou remember this whimpering, thick, nauseous feeling\nFrom your step-brother chasing you around with a staple gun when you were young\nIt was fun and then suddenly pain became a very real thing\nDo you remember that feeling?\nSimilarly, this isn’t fiction\nWell, actually mostly it is\nOr a series of IRL moments cloaked in the vagueness that songs give\nBut when there’s nothing to say and you’ve got to say something\nFuck, I don’t even know\nWe pass on the street and say “hi” cause we have to\nEven though both of us are clearly just like “I FUCKING HATE YOU”\nSo stilted and silent, not awkward just angry\nHey I gotta go, but I’ll see you at the show\nIt’s that song everybody loves, but the lyrics are garbage\nAnd it stresses me out how often you’re mentioned\nIt’s like everyone we know collectively vomited up a pile of brown sweaters or something and were so impressed with the results\nThat they put them on the wall\nAnd I’m so sad you’re in my head\nAnd I’m so sorry it’s so venomous\nEspecially because we’ve got like maybe four or five words ever spoken between us\nBut I can’t heave my heart into my mouth\nI can’t tell you\nI can’t stop you\nI don’t want to\nThis first day of school shit just seems to keep happening\nEverybody says “Man, it’s so cool. We’re so glad you’re doing your own thing!”\nBut worse than disdain is colossal indifference\nThe smiles are so big\nAnd there’s no one at the gig\nI’m either deep in the woods or on TV for everyone\nAnd I know– it’s disgusting how much I think about myself in relation to nothing\nThe things that aren’t gonna stay just aren’t gonna stay\nLike; I was getting a tooth pulled in the free clinic in Portland in 2007\nThe dentist turned out to be this dude, a drummer whose band I’d recorded, and somehow that was comforting\nThen the Novocaine block kicked in\nIt closed up my throat and I was ready to go home\nMaybe once this record comes out then I can stop drinking\nThat might look good on a press release or something\nIf they even still do those\nWait, I’m certain they still do those\nAnd then the summer comes and then the fall comes\nAnd then the winter comes and then the spring comes\nAnd then the summer comes and then the fall comes\nAnd then the winter comes and then the spring comes\nAnd then the summer comes and then the fall comes\nAnd then the winter comes and then the spring comes","url":"https://genius.com/Fred-thomas-bad-blood-lyrics"}
