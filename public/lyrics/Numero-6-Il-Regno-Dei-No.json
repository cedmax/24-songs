Tuono)","lyrics":"Verse 1: Anonymous-G\n\nYou know were gonna kill it once I get up on the track\nGambino is elemental so you know the homie echo had to bring a nigga back\nGotta hit-em with a little bit of venom to infect their minds\nThat's right, I'm tight\nMake nigga jealous when he fuckin heard my rhymes\nThat's right I bite\nFreaking a beat and leaving the scene destroyed with \"dumbfounded\" minds\nYou don't wanna be around a mothefucka when hes sippin fine whine\nCause its my time to shine bright\nImma take a semi automatic and kill all you suckas  with a \"tech n9ne\"\nDon't try to fight\nStep In this lyrical lobotomy with some oddities\nYou might just get run over trying to pass the finish line\nI'mma pop shot, jaw drop\nTake a stupid rapper to the\nChop shop, while I'm\nKillin mumble rappers for bein hella dumb\nTheir shit is wack\nThat's a fact\nImma attack from the back\nBetter bring the lyrical speed if you wanna last in this rap\nYou might wanna step back\nFrom the blood and gore on the floor\nThis elemental choppers 4\n\n\nVerse 2: Exodu$\n\nWe in the server of the underground p$ycho, and cipher is sicker then the sickest, slithering, snake, silently, sticking\nAnd skipping, like a lost slipper\nMy six, sense, says, the sheik's sheep sitting there sinking, sideways, in the salty, sand, are shining in succession\nJust like my p$ycho session that is my confession\nSo, Consider a stripper that's looser then a zipper, unzip her, tip her, then kick her even quicker, laid out like a printer, please pause properly pick and pop pills like peter\nThen like chris brown you can beat her\nI'm going be coming around and bringing a world of pain\nYou don't want to really get it when your stepping to the AK-47\nMac-11, shootin em up with my weapon\nThinking about, open em up, and hear em mumbling about sps\nGive me the measure, give me the line, 30sps waste of a time?\nAin't ever gonna be stopped'\nMotherfuckers be thinking about they wanna get popped'\nRunning with a millimeter when i chop'\nLike twisted insane leaving niggas get chopped'\nLooking at you motherfuckers who wanna get dropped'\nThinking that you're coming and bringing it better\nFinna get locked'\nYou don't want to really get it, like a picture i'll leave you cropped'\nHit em with that 45 Beretta' or with my fucking Glock\n\n\nVerse 3: Dvagoh\n\nChop elementale compà eccome se fa male quando coeso a questi schemi, impongo peso e non stai in piedi, interconnesso via vari mezzi ai poteri di Dei, e li esercito sul beat contro viventi terreni\nDunque impugno falci, preparo una rete fitta fatta in legacci e ganci, tempo di cacciare tutti i rapper più scarsi, vorresti scappare ma ormai è troppo tardi\nUpgrade del flow ergo lo iato è giustificato arrivo subito al quattro con un'unica rincorsa, che mi sono ottimizzato, enormemente levigato, un masso che non mi smuovi manco con l'MN Forza\nSe compi una mossa con qualsiasi pezzo è un'L, la portata del giorno- di un nemico le budelle, tu senti una fitta improvvisa e poi vedi la zanna serpentina ed il veleno che infierisce indelebile su pelle\nChiamo il time out vi lascio a leccarvi le ferite, prometto: nessuno è pronto, parte 2 è la vostra fine\nRiporto la guerra però niente '39 quando ho una mitraglietta e la riempio di parole, si potrebbe dissentire, odiare e anche contestare, ciò non toglie quel siluro già mirato al tuo rettale, arsenale lirico immenso in questi versi te lo mostro, il beat l'ho già fatto a pezzi però non ho ancora corso\nOvvio alla carenza uccido con una carezza al traguardo con chiarezza ed ho un unico rimorso\nIl corpo del nemico è già un giocattolo rotto\nCerchi di meglio però davanti è impervio, mantengo il mio regno e nemmeno sto in sede, testo complesso ma arriva presto lesto ma forte come una mazza di legno e poi siete a terra, out\n\nA [14.4 SPS CLAIM]\n\n\nVerse 4: Saint Sinister\n\nIve written out A riddle to put it in your brain\nIm boutta smoke ya face like it was a different strain\nI wanna become a killa got the heart of a villain, make a market of the feelins cuz I got no emotion\nDrop til you roastin\nMonster is the closest\nOfferin no posin\nWater and osmosis\nWreckin wit a syllable, he steppin to an interval\nOf godly lyrics, ah shit im fearless\nClippin clear hits, Shippin mirrors bitch\nSo you can see that you're soon be\nAn excuse of a creature misused the preacher\nCuz teachin the best is mistake  you\nGrabbin for your vest you little piss stain\nIll master the lesson and then gain\nA whole new class of kids playin\nSmoke the weed and Ill own the beats\nYou Messin with the better man a muthafuckin veteran thats settin  with a caliber, checkin out a pound of herb, diggin under the ground of earth, runnin from the sound you heard, mothers fuckin up on their childs birth\nI gotta write to honor my promise to life\nYeah Comin from the bottom an i gotta get to top, an I never will stop except to chop and to prove a point\nIll move ya boys to join my side\nCuz the posionous Eyes that I have\nLook all around and see skies black\nYou better be runnin on the right track\nDevelopin elemental and my cursing is not proper\nSinister wit it gonna leave you in a coffin\nKickin niggas down now lets go pop up\nSeverin summoner heads im an elemental chopper\n\n\nVerse 5: MurrK\n\nAll the elements of the world come together\nWhatever the weather whenever you want time don't matter\nCoz I'm here with mother nature back for MSL quantum entanglement part 2 time will shatter\nCoz I'm here with the aluminium elemental knowledge in my brain\nBuilt of Bohrs from back then to today\nFinding out their shit like a Michael Bay\nLet's see the 4 elements and crash you like mayday\nThere's them fire bars, lyrics and sick rhyme schemes\nEven better than my BG shit grime memes\nLike its possible to woffle awful shit but when ya boi Murko spits he spits rhymes clean\nThen there's that chill flowing\nThat you gotta keep going\nRepeating the same motion\nLike you're in a boat rowing\nThen they'll all be knowing\nThat when you get to flowing\nYou'll be top of the top of all them Hellfires showing\nThen there's speed ting\nHacking the mac in your bag and I'm creeping up into your bank account and I'm taking and stacking and piling the cash\nThen there's that one final part\nWhere you combine everything and perfect the art\nAll I do is animation\nFucking 'em all with the contamination\nTaking over the rap internations\nDucking the shot assassination\nTrapping 'em all like Yugioh\nGetting hotter like its julio\nBreaking your spinal cord\nAnd making your rap's final fall\nLeaking your secrets like 'who'd he show?'\nCross world shot pierce your wind pipe with a cross bow\nBreaking and entering homes\nTaking and fucking the homes\nThinking of banging and breaking and killing Vietnam flashbacks like I'm Bonez\n\n\nVerse 6: Deus\n\nIm punishin' you niggas like a bully in 3rd grade I celebrate everyday when I cause you pain I'm insane in the brain fucking everthing up like I'm losing the game ain't gotta explain\nWhy I'm dangerous and strange\nGet up on the stage cause I can maintain a syllabic flow while I'm kicking down the door and I hit em wit the precision of sniper scope as I'm takin all their souls and you'll never come close\nComing and bringin the havoc while im fixing to do the voodoo\nHittin' (crip)pled niggas before they can su-woop\nLooking in my bag for my midget AK\nYou know I use it at least once a day\nGotta get em before they get me whenever I dump a clip up in the strip never miss never be pissed when I get dissed and reminisce on the old days and be the one to start a new wave\nGotta get the speed when I dump it like a 16\nPaintin' my lyrics like the roof of the Sistine\nTalkin' about choppin' but what do you really mean cause I'll get choppin' like a brand new guillotine\nStickin' and dickin' your girl down up in the back\nRippin' and fuckin' up the beat as we attack on the track\nIt's elemental choppers 4 what fuck are you waiting 4\nDirty wit the flow call that shit rancor\n\n\nVerse 7: Echo\n\n\nVerse 8: KillerAP\n\nGuess I'm here to kill a beat tonight\nYeah cuz I be the best in the biz\nAin't nobody really wanna step to the kid\nYeah you best cover your ears tonight\nRhythm and rhyme master killing subprime actors\nPedal to the medal and we're heading for another level\nYeah cuz we elemental, earth wind fire and ice\nYeah my mic sound nice but I ain't getting sentimental\nBetter stop with all that hater shit or you be\nTasting the heavy metal\nBathing in cobalt\nRage when I go off\nCaged in with no lock\nLet me kill off this instrumental\n[Now it's time to slow it down to when I'm\nEven with the rhythm cuz imma need it when I go insane]\nMy mind is a prison I'm brainsick\nMy mic is a weapon I'm aimin\nAt all of you phony rappers that are\nTryna be holy factors y'all are playin\nI don't wanna be the one to have to tell you suckas\nThat your only days are fading cuz im\nBreaking it down\nTakin em out\nAnybody thinking of taking the crown\nI'm gonna come in to make a debacle and\nHit em with a little bit of venomous sound\nAin't no where to run when I come with the heat and flow but they waiting me to finish so Imma just let it goK\nKillerAP, HipHopScience, you already know\n\n\nVerse 9: Tuono\n\nEntro sul beat ed è già un omicidio, quando mi sentono mi urlano \"sei mitico!\"\nSì, sono mitico, mudico, multiplo, non me ne fotte più un cazzo del pubblico\nNon me ne fotte più un cazzo di te che senza pensare mi rispondi subito\nAmmazzo tutti sopra il quarto quarto, tu sei il dessert e ti killo per ultimo\nE chissene se alla fine sto flow non ti aggrada, smetti col rap e, fra, cambia strada\nCome nel terzo gli alcolici, pina colada, l'ultimo mio sfidante sta roba l'ha mollata\nNei tuoi testi l'amico che è morto perché sta dose se l'è calata\nE tu che vivi da parassita più che mai na gioia\nMai una patata, ormai continuo perché, davvero, la mia dignità è andata\nStarò qui a dissare un bambino obeso che mangia la cioccolata\nE lo sai, non mi fermo mai, mi sono allenato molto, mi sento quasi un samurai\nE che palle, cazzo, non ho mai argomenti\nNon so come rimare, prendi i calci nei denti\nSono tecnico, chiaro, no? Limpidissimo, tu mi chiedi \"oh, mi dissi bro?\" e io ti rispondo \"sì, fighissimo!\"\nSono fortissimo, altissimo, no, bassissimo, e ora la smetto subitissimo perché di rime con issimo ce n'è un numero vastissimo\n\n\nVerse 10: D-Struction\n\n\nVerse 11: Mistery\n\nJumping from 2 to 4, Mistery really not folklore, scoring more goals than Archie, but it's not soccor, coming to get em I tore through it, weak arm or, I'm not taking no more\nReally wanna get it I'm a killa who will fill em in a minute I'ma chop it to the finish im sicker than a menace named Wayne gacy, my pacing amazing, I'm killing elemental choppers 4\nImminent damaging, been in it banishing, surprisingly crazy, im flaming with kerosene, dont ever come around me if you're never definining insanity, vanity, I'm standing for defiance, i am so godly the Mayans would prolly just buy me, the flow has entangled me, banging the beats, i want you to hate on me, I really do need it\nCause it empowers me to make better music, when I get to ripping it's gonna quick not gonna miss, dump em in abyss, get down with the sickness, taking away your life with this biz, you will to need to learn that I can stuff you in an urn\nAny minute Imma turn into a worldwide murderer, burning everybody in the vicinity, are you gonna be the next person dead up on the curb, so many worse things than words which is why the things are said are gonna really gonna hurt, chanting a hex and whatevers left of your body is my next breakfast, definitely the best chopper on the whole list I'm relentless sick and vicious wrecking em up with quickness what do you really want from me besides a menace chopping it up a kid named MISTERY\n\n\nVerse 12: Mythical\n\n\nVerse 13: ERA\n\nTell me, \"What you wanna do with the menace?\" I promise Era is the one that'll finish\nYou hate on Era when the time comes to listen, but when he  blow up; don't you ask to be vivid\nWhat until the number one comes to mention?
