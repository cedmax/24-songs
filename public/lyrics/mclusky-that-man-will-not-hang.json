{"title":"That Man Will Not Hang by ​mclusky","lyrics":"[Verse 1]\nThere's a story for a thimble\nOn a dimple, on a pea\nAnd it's absolutely true until the end\nWhen they pan out in the titles\nWe can see you're still alive\nAnd the maitre'd is not your special friend\nThere's a road in a wrong place twice as far out\nAnd a bitch on a bridge, yeah the bridge was a bitch\nWith a heavenly drawn out roll of her lips\nShe undid the straps and smiled\n\n[Chorus]\nThat man will not hang\nThat man he will never hang\nThat man will not hang\nThat man he will never hang\nThat man will not hang\nThat man he will never hang\nThat man will not hang\nThat man\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere's a man you should meet\nAnd he might be under arrest\nBut believe me when i tell you he's ok\nHe ran the mohawk out of living rooms across the land\nAnd introduced me to the joys of doubt\nThere's a dream, there's a barn\nThere was a story, it was a boring one\nBut honestly, I tried to stay awake\nBorn to hang and proud of it\nI base my claim on credit\n\n[Chorus]\nThat man will not hang\nThat man he will never hang\nThat man will not hang\nThat man he will never hang\nThat man will not hang\nThat man he will never hang\nThat man will not hang\nThat man he will never hang\nThat man will not hang\nThat man he will never hang\nThat man will not hang\nThat man he will never hang\nThat man will not hang\nThat man he will never hang\nThat man will not hang\nThat man\n\n[Verse 3]\nHe realized he wanted to have children with this girl\nHe pulled her to his side and quietly\nGave away his heart like it was his to give away\nGave away his heart like it was his to give away\nWednesday the studio come knocking\nExcuse them but they need their property\nGave away his heart like it was his to give away\nGave away his heart like it was his to give away\nGave away his heart like it was his to give away\nGave away his heart like it was his to give away\nGave away his heart like it was his to give away\nGave away his heart like it was his to give away","url":"https://genius.com/Mclusky-that-man-will-not-hang-lyrics"}
